A report quoting sources in the Ministry of External Affairs has said that discussions between the two sides are underway and significant progress has been made towards the goal of finalising a trade deal. US President Donald Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on India - among the highest in the world.The comments made to ANI come just a day after negotiations with the European Union on a free trade agreement were concluded. The India-EU FTA has been described as the “mother of all deals”. India has now turned its focus to bringing its trade pact with the United States to a conclusion. The trade deal aims to more than double two way trade from the current level of $191 billion to $500 billion by 2030. Initial discussions on the agreement were announced during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Washington in February 2025.India-US Trade Deal: What’s the progress?Sources in the Ministry of External Affairs told ANI that discussions on the India US agreement have advanced substantially. The agreement is close to completion and could be sealed at any time, with only minor formalities left to be addressed, according to an ANI report quoting the MEA officials.The report quoted the officials saying that the India-US trade deal could be ‘finalised any day now’. They went on to say that it is ‘just the dotting of the Is and the crossing of the Ts"".Sources quoted in the ANI report described the most recent round of talks between the two sides as particularly solid, reflecting steady momentum and constructive dialogue. The sense of progress was also echoed by US President Donald Trump during his visit to Davos on January 21, where he spoke positively about the proposed India0US Bilateral Trade Agreement and expressed confidence that both countries would reach a favourable outcome.Also Read | India-EU FTA: Can ‘mother of all trade deals’ offset impact of Trump’s tariffs? ExplainedSpeaking after his address at the 56th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a trusted friend and respected leader, saying, “I have great respect for your Prime Minister. He’s a fantastic man and a friend of mine, and we are going to have a good deal,” in response to a query from Moneycontrol.Earlier, Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal had indicated that the long awaited first phase of the bilateral trade agreement was approaching completion, although he did not specify a date. Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said that India stands to gain the most from the recently concluded India-EU FTA. Speaking in an interview with Fox News, Greer said the EU was increasingly looking to India as an alternative market, given its heavy reliance on trade and the challenges it faces in continuing to export large volumes to the United States.Addressing questions on US tariffs linked to India’s continued purchases of Russian crude, Greer said Washington expects New Delhi to gradually reduce such imports. He acknowledged that India had already made notable progress, adding that he remains in regular contact with his Indian counterpart and described their engagement as constructive. However, he said challenges remain due to the price advantage of Russian oil, and noted that tighter sanctions introduced by the US Treasury Department in recent weeks are expected to accelerate the process."

The precious metals continued to reach record levels on the Multi-Commodity Exchange(MCX) as the white metal nears the Rs 4 lakh mark and gold jumps 3%.The momentum comes just ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, which is being closely watched by global investors. Gold futures expiring on February 5, 2026, climbed sharply in early trade, rising Rs 4,800, or 3%, to Rs 1,62,429 per 10 grams. Silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery posted even steeper gains, jumping Rs 21,400, or 6%, to Rs 3,77,655 per kg, marking fresh lifetime highs for both contracts on the MCX. Global markets followed the strength seen domestically. International gold prices crossed the $5,200-an-ounce mark on Wednesday, touching an all-time high as the US dollar weakened to a near four-year low amid persistent geopolitical concerns. The rally unfolded ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision later in the day. Spot silver rose 0.6% to $113.63 an ounce, after having touched a record high of $117.69 on Monday. Silver has already gained nearly 60% so far this year. Market participants are now awaiting cues from the Federal Reserve, with any indication of a pause or easing in interest rates expected to influence broader sentiment. Lower interest rates generally weigh on bond yields, making non-yielding assets such as gold and silver more attractive to investors. Strong safe-haven buying driven by heightened global uncertainty continues to support precious metals, Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart told ET. He noted that the dollar index has seen a sharp decline, slipping to nearly a four-year low. A rebound in the Japanese yen and concerns over the possible dumping of US Treasuries by European countries amid the Greenland issue are adding further pressure on the dollar. While the overall environment remains supportive for gold and silver, price action is expected to remain highly volatile. Despite the volatility, silver is expected to hold a crucial support level at $98 per troy ounce, while gold is likely to sustain support near $4,980 per troy ounce on a closing basis during the week. In the near term, both metals are expected to witness sharp fluctuations, tracking movements in the dollar index, the outcome of the Fed policy meeting and ongoing geopolitical developments. Gold has support in the $5,084–$5,055 range and faces resistance between $5,174 and $5,220 per troy ounce. Silver is supported at $102.40–$98 and encounters resistance in the $112–$118 range, Manoj added. On the MCX, gold is expected to find support at Rs 1,56,600–Rs 1,55,000, while resistance is placed at Rs 1,59,800–Rs 1,62,000. Silver has support at Rs 3,50,000–Rs 3,44,000 and resistance between Rs 3,65,000 and Rs 3,78,000. The trading strategy is to buy the yellow metal on dips as long as it holds Rs 1,56,000 on a closing basis, targeting Rs 1,65,000. Silver can also be accumulated on falls while it sustains Rs 3,44,000 on a closing basis, with an upside target of Rs 3,70,000–Rs 3,84,000.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own.

The Parliament’s Budget session began on January 28, 2026 and the first phase is expected to conclude on February 13, 2026. The Union Budget 2026 will be presented by FM Sitharaman on February 1, 2026 - likely the first time when the Budget is presented on a Sunday.Each year, the Economic Survey is closely seen by economists and policy analysts since it offers a very detailed assessment of the Indian economy’s performance over the past year, along with insights into the future growth prospects across various sectors.What is the Economic Survey, who prepares it?The Economic Survey is a very comprehensive annual economic review which is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance. The Economic Survey bears the name of the Chief Economic Advisor, who at present is Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey presents an in-depth analysis of macroeconomic parameters, key fiscal and financial indicators, and forward-looking assessments.

Each year, its overarching theme draws close attention from policymakers and observers alike.The Survey contains detailed sector-wise reviews along with dedicated chapters on economic concerns."

Key measures included digitized registration systems, single-window construction approvals, unified RERA dashboards and simplified compliance norms. These interventions reduced delays, improved accountability and encouraged wider institutional participation. Complementary policy frameworks such as Gati Shakti, National Logistics Policy and Data-center incentives supported growth in non-traditional asset classes. The sector currently contributes nearly 8% to national GDP and is expected to contribute 15% to 16% to national GDP by 2047 towards our vision of “Viksit Bharat”. It would need support from the direct tax and indirect tax policies of the government during this journey.Budget expectations for Real Estate SectorGiven the government’s objective of housing for all some of the expectations that could be looked at - reintroduction of tax holiday for affordable housing with a tweak that the eligibility for affordable housing should be based on size of flat rather than valueNeed for increasing the interest tax deduction from Rs 2 lakh to at least 5 lakhs and allowing set-off of loss from the house property under new tax regimeNeed to re-introduce additional interest tax deduction on loan for certain house properties (which had a sunset in FY2022)point of taxation deferred to obtaining CC for landowners being individuals and HUFs, for area share joint development arrangements. In absence of provisions for corporate landowners, there are conflicting views on point of taxation (i.e., upfront vs deferred). Need to provide comprehensive yardstick for determining point of taxation and provide guidance for computation of taxable income in case of upfront taxationwhile computing tax fair value of equity shares, income tax law provides for substitution of book value of immovable property with stamp duty value (SDV). There are conflicting views that deeming provisions extend to leasehold rights/ development rights (which differ from freehold land and building). Need to clarify that SDV referencing should not apply to leasehold/ development rightsNeed to introduce targeted tax incentives to encourage greater investments in the hospitality and tourism sector, given the government’s ongoing push to promote tourism sites nationwide,while the credit linked subsidy scheme (‘CLSS’) which had expired in 2022 was revamped under PMAY U 2.0 bringing a renewed version of the CLSS it has been less incentivizing compared to the erstwhile CLSS. Providing further subsidy, increasing the limits under the revamped CLSS could be a great opportunity to enable EWS, LIG and MIG sections of society purchase houses or undertake modifications, tax incentive for rental housing to promote it as important investment class and create more affordable rentals. While the GST rate cuts on construction materials by the 56th GST Council was a welcome move, the real estate industry continues to seek clarity on long-standing issues which significantly influence housing and leasing costs. For example, reforming ITC eligibility for leased assets is not merely an industry demand but an essential step toward aligning GST with its core principle of tax neutrality, ensuring India's continued attractiveness as a global business destination. The inability to claim ITC has significant financial impact on large-scale commercial infrastructure projects. This has a direct impact on setting up Data-center/ Global Capability Centers, mindset of foreign investors, startups and enterprises relying on cost-effective leasing options etc.Many countries, including the UK, Australia, and Singapore, allow ITC on commercial property construction, provided the asset is used for taxable supplies such as commercial leasing. India could benefit from a similar approach, ensuring tax neutrality and eliminating cascading effects. To mitigate concerns about excessive credit claims, the budget could provide for ITC to be allowed in equal instalments over four to five years and could be subject to reversal upon sale of the building, based on a predefined formula.An area of persisting ambiguity is the taxation of joint development arrangements. From taxability to valuation to timing of payment of tax, there is a pressing need to address the appropriate tax treatment of:Transfer of development rights (TDR)Floor space index (FSI)GST impact on area share vs revenue share models of joint development agreements (Adarsh Ranka is Partner and National Real Estate Leader, Member Firm of EY Global)"

Technology and auto stocks found support, while healthcare shares declined sharply after the Trump administration proposed a Medicare Advantage payment increase of less than 1 per cent for 2027.Health insurers came under heavy pressure, dragging the Dow lower. UnitedHealth Group and Humana lost nearly 16 per cent of their value before the opening bell, while Elevance Health fell 7.9 per cent and CVS Health dropped 13 per cent, according to AP. Investors were disappointed by the lower-than-expected rate increase, which threatens profit margins in Medicare Advantage plans that cover Americans aged 65 and above.UnitedHealth, the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the US, reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue close to estimates but warned that its revenue could decline in 2026.

They can withdraw benefits as a lump sum or as fixed-interval payouts, including monthly payments. The platform offers portability across platforms, along with digital KYC and onboarding. Urban Company will drive awareness and access across its service partner network.Abhiraj Singh Bhal, co-founder and CEO of Urban Company, said, “This builds on our longstanding investments in partner welfare: spanning skill development, insurance, access to credit and income stability, and reinforces our commitment to a more sustainable and inclusive ecosystem.”Sriram Iyer, managing director and CEO of HDFC Pension, said, “Gig and platform workers are an indispensable pillar of India’s evolving workforce. This is a strong need to provide them access to structured retirement solutions. Through the association with Urban Company, we are taking another productive step towards bridging this gap by making the National Pension System more accessible, simple and digitally enabled for platform workers. This initiative mirrors our commitment to expanding pension coverage and supporting long-term financial security for India’s growing gig economy.”India’s platform workforce is projected at 23.5 million by 2030, yet remains largely outside formal retirement planning due to limited awareness and access. HDFC Pension said it has on-boarded close to one lakh gig workers under the Platform Workers Model through multiple tie-ups, enabling small, periodic contributions with withdrawals as a lump sum and pension on retirement.Set up in 2011, HDFC Pension is licensed by PFRDA to manage pension corpus under the National Pension System and is a wholly owned subsidiary of HDFC Life.Urban Company runs a technology-driven platform linking customers with home and beauty service professionals.

Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport.Airlines slash schedulesAmerican Airlines cancelled over 1,400 flights on Sunday, about 45% of its scheduled operations, FlightAware data showed.Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines each reported more than 1,200 cancellations, while United Airlines cancelled over 860 flights. JetBlue scrapped more than 570 flights, accounting for roughly 71% of its schedule for the day.Flight cancelled? Here’s what to doIf you are already at the airport, airlines advise getting in line to speak with a customer service representative. If you are still at home or at a hotel, passengers should call or go online to contact the airline’s reservations staff. Travellers are also advised to research alternate flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no extra charge, subject to seat availability.Can you switch airlines?Passengers can seek to be booked on another airline, but carriers are not required to place travellers on a competing airline’s flight. Some airlines, including major carriers, may offer rebooking on partner airlines, though availability is not guaranteed, the Associated Press reported.Are you entitled to a refund?If a flight is cancelled and a passenger chooses not to travel or finds another way to reach their destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The rule applies regardless of the reason for the cancellation."

The disclosures included tax information of President Trump and thousands of other high-income individuals.Court filings said Littlejohn deliberately sought a contractor role to gain access to Trump’s tax returns and methodically learned how to extract data without raising internal alarms.The Treasury Department said it currently holds 31 contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, involving annual spending of $4.8 million and total obligations of $21 million.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the contracts were ended because the firm “failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service”.The move effectively cuts Booz Allen off from Treasury-related work linked to taxpayer data.A representative of Booz Allen Hamilton was not immediately available for comment, as reported AP."

India’s real GDP growth is estimated at 7.4% in FY26 led by investment demand and services sector growth. More than a system of payments or lending, the FS sector today acts as the economy’s central engine by allocating capital, pricing risk, and transmitting policy signals across the real economy. When this engine operates efficiently, it amplifies growth across infrastructure, manufacturing, MSMEs, households, and the expanding footprints of the digital ecosystem.A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries. In India, banks, NBFCs, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds, and capital markets channel household and institutional savings into productive investments across the economy. This steady flow of capital drives GDP growth, improves productivity, formalises activity, and supports MSMEs and start‑ups through credit, funding, and risk‑mitigation tools. To sustain this momentum, Budget 2026 must focus on strengthening credit systems, deepening markets, and ensuring a predictable and innovation‑friendly regulatory environment. Continuity of the pace of tax reforms with the mantra of ‘simplification’ being the core objective will play a vital role in shaping India’s competitiveness as a global financial hub. A rationalisation of the tax regime for foreign bank branches—which currently face an effective tax rate of 38.22 percent -- would create a more balanced environment for global institutions. Extending withholding tax exemption on interest received to NBFCs similar to the exemption provided to Banks would introduce operational efficiency and arrest cash flow leakages for NBFCs helping them focus on greater penetration.Judicial clarity and global alignment are equally important. Recent Supreme Court rulings in the Tiger Global and American Express have implications for foreign investors and foreign banks. The global investor community is looking at clear and upfront tax guidance which would provide the predictability needed for investment decisions. The global investor community would be keenly looking at how the Hon’ble Finance Minister balances the expectations of the global investor community in respect of their past as well as the future investments. Alongside these reforms, India has been gaining prominence as an emerging international financial services centre (IFSC) through the development of GIFT City. Past Budgets have provided regulatory and tax relaxations that have enabled strong and steady progress. Global and Indian investors are regularly coming up with newer business models in GIFT City, which needs regulatory and tax amendments for enabling the same. Continuing with the past practice, Budget 2026 should continue to promote GIFT City for development of new business activities and products in GIFT City. The emerging areas of Global / Regional Treasury Centres, Commodity Trading, and Oilfield Equipment leasing will be eagerly looking up to Budget 2026 for regulatory support and tax clarity.Notifying the framework for Variable Capital Company structures would significantly widen the range of fund‑management activities within the IFSC. As the re‑insurance market in GIFT City continues to expand, it will be important to ensure a level playing field for Lloyd’s syndicates to attract larger pools of global capacity. Collectively, these reforms can materially enhance GIFT City’s attractiveness for banks, asset managers, treasury centres, insurers, leasing platforms, and other cross‑border financial participants.Similar to recent Budgets, timely disposal of tax assessments and appeals must remain a priority. With about INR 26.3 lakh crore—around 8 percent of India’s GDP—locked in income‑tax disputes, direct‑tax litigation continues to be a major concern. This issue is particularly significant for the FS sector, where cases often involve legacy matters that require clear and consistent guidance from tax authorities and take years to be resolved. Establishing defined timelines and accountability frameworks would enhance trust and reduce uncertainty for financial institutions and investors.To conclude, India’s FS sector is positioned to power the nation’s next phase of growth. Budget 2026 can accelerate this transition by pairing targeted policy support with competitive tax rules. Strengthening FS institutions, deepening markets, and improving digital and regulatory architecture will expand the economy’s credit capacity, strengthen inclusion, and reinforce India’s emergence as a global financial hub—creating the investment foundation needed for sustainable and long‑term growth. These financial sector reforms will go a long way in not only sustaining GDP growth but also in boosting the per capita income of India’s population.(Jugal Kajaria is Tax Partner – EY India.

A statement issued by this network on Wednesday pointed out that though the National Health Policy had promised public spending of 2.5% of GDP on health, it has remained alarmingly low at 1.15%.“Government’s own commitment in the national health policy of 2017 was that 40% of public expenditure should be the Union government's responsibility. This translates to 1% of GDP or Rs. 350,000 crore at today's prices. That's what we expect the Union budget to commit,” said Ravi Duggal, Sociologist, health researcher and activist.Development economist and social activist Jean Dreze said that India is one of the world champions of public under-spending in healthcare. “For decades, public expenditure on healthcare has hovered around 1% of GDP, compared with an average of 3% in developing countries today. The result of this accumulated under-investment is a huge deficit in public health facilities. Universal health care cannot be achieved without a serious effort to address this deficit and transform healthcare standards in the public sector,” said Dreze.

RamasamiCotton occupies a critical place in India’s agricultural and industrial economy. It supports millions of farm households, feeds a globally competitive textile sector, and remains one of the country’s most widely cultivated commercial crops. Yet, despite this significance, cotton today faces a paradox; while production continues at scale, productivity gains have stagnated and cultivation risks have intensified.Though cotton anchors India’s agrarian economy, yet faces a critical paradox: while production scale remains vast, productivity has stagnated and farming risks have intensified. This stagnation mirrors a broader national challenge. With India’s R&D intensity hovering at just about 0.7% of GDP, long-gestation crops like cotton lack the deep, continuous investment required to sustain innovation pipelines.While India remains a top global producer, yields have flatlined amidst escalating pest and climate pressures. The defining crisis is the absence of new technology - earlier scientific gains have faded, leaving farmers to battle modern field realities with ageing, inadequate tools. Mechanization: the non-negotiable necessityOne of the clearest manifestations of this strain is visible in the economics of cotton harvesting. Unlike many other crops, cotton is harvested manually, often through multiple pickings across the season. Picking alone can account for roughly 30–35% of total cultivation costs, making labour the single largest cost component in cotton production.This dependence on manual labour is becoming untenable. Labour scarcity during peak season especially, picking pushes costs higher, creates uncertainty, and impacts farmers' margins. In several regions, timely availability of pickers has become as critical a risk as pests or weather - making mechanisation an absolute necessity, not a choice.But mechanisation cannot succeed with developing machines alone. Cotton plants must be specifically bred for machine compatibility - uniform architecture, synchronized boll opening, appropriate height, and so on. Developing such machinery-ready hybrids demands focused, investment-heavy R&D programs with enormous scientific, technical, and economic challenges.In this context, is why weighted tax deduction on R&D expenditure is essential. It would unlock sustained private investment, accelerate development of mechanisation-suited varieties, and reduce farmers' exposure to labour shocks while improving competitiveness and profitability.Further, a key bottleneck is trash content: machine-harvested kapas often carries 8–12% extraneous matter, compared to much lower levels in manual picking, while markets typically accept cotton with trash below about 2%. Without addressing this gap, mechanization may not help despite reducing dependence on manual labour. Field-level pre-cleaning technologies are therefore essential, enabling farmers to lower trash content at the farm gate and ensure that mechanization strengthens, rather than weakens, farm incomes.Thus, to ensure India’s cotton sector remains competitive, addressing these challenges such as pest resistance, climate resilience, or mechanization, requires sustained, long-term research commitment by the companies. This requires science-based, stable and predictable policy and regulatory frameworks.Cotton innovation involves multi-year trials, validation across regions, and coordination between breeders, engineers, agronomists, and regulators. Here, the issue of ease of research becomes central. When research pathways are unpredictable or approvals are prolonged, timelines stretch and costs escalate. Long-gestation research becomes harder to justify, particularly in a national context where overall R&D intensity is already constrained. The result is not a lack of ideas, but a thinning of serious, sustained research efforts precisely where they are most needed.Why Budget 2026 mattersAs India approaches Union Budget 2026, cotton offers a clear illustration of why agricultural research must be treated as strategic infrastructure rather than discretionary spending. Short-term measures, input support, procurement, or relief interventions, play an important role in stabilizing farm incomes. However, they cannot resolve productivity plateaus or structural cost pressures rooted in technological gaps. Those require patient investment in science.At this crucial juncture, two long-standing policy measures warrant immediate attention and swift action.First, the restoration of the 200% weighted tax deduction on R&D expenditure. Agricultural research involves high upfront costs, long timelines, and uncertain outcomes. Weighted tax incentives acknowledge this reality and help sustain investment in problem-solving science, particularly in crops like cotton where innovation cycles are inherently long.Second, GST rationalization for seeds. Seeds are the foundation of productivity, yet their current tax treatment adds avoidable cost to an essential input. Rationalization would ease the burden on farmers while improving liquidity for seed developers, indirectly strengthening the research-to-farm continuum. These measures are not demands in isolation; they are enabling signals that align fiscal policy with the realities of agricultural innovation.From managing risk to enabling resilienceCotton research is ultimately farm-level risk management. When innovation pipelines slow, farmers are forced into higher input use, delayed operations, and greater exposure to labour and market shocks. When science delivers on time, better pest solutions, mechanization-ready hybrids, or improved pre-cleaning—farmers gain stability and predictability.Cotton’s future will be determined less by acreage and more by how effectively seed research helps ensure raw material security for the textile sector in the wake of fast changing economic, ecological and geopolitical realities. Union Budget 2026 is a decisive opportunity: strengthen R&D incentives, rationalize input taxation, and make ease of doing research a policy priority to rebuilding the cotton innovation pipeline.That would reaffirm a simple truth: sustainable agriculture is built not on short-term fixes, but on long-term investment in science that helps farmers cope, compete, and endure.(The author is the former Chairman, Federation of Seed Industry of India and Chairman, Rasi Seeds (P) Ltd)"

India faces 50% tariffs on its exports to the US - 25% of which are for Russian crude oil imports which the Trump administration claims helps indirectly finance the Russian war against Ukraine.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said that India still needs to address outstanding US concerns over its continued purchases of Russian crude if it hopes to obtain relief from US tariffs. Officials from both countries have been engaged in negotiations for several months over reducing the 50% duty imposed by President Donald Trump last year. Despite this pressure, discounted Russian crude continues to account for a sizeable share of India’s oil imports, a trend analysts expect could extend into 2026.Also Read |‘Just about dotting Is, crossing the Ts’: India-US trade deal may be ‘finalised any day now’: ReportIndia needs to do more: Trump aide on Russian oilSpeaking in an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, Greer noted that India has taken steps to reduce imports of Russian oil. However, he noted that a complete shift away remains difficult, largely because of the discounts offered by discounted Russian supplies. “They like the discount that you get from Russian oil,” he said according to a Bloomberg report, adding that despite regular engagement with his Indian counterpart and a strong working relationship, progress on this front remains unresolved. Meanwhile, India has concluded a long-awaited free trade agreement with the European Union, nearly 20 years in the making. The pact, called the ‘mother of all deals’ is widely viewed as a response to Trump’s increasingly protectionist trade stance.Commenting on the development, Greer said India stands to gain significantly from the agreement. “Frankly, they have more market access into Europe. It sounds like they have some additional immigration rights,” he said. He added that India’s low-cost labour base could give it a strong advantage, while suggesting that the EU appears to be reinforcing globalization even as the US seeks to address its downsides.The Trump administration has been sending mixed signals on Russian oil-linked tariffs. Last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the US may consider rolling back the additional 25%tariffs imposed on India after a sharp decline in New Delhi’s imports of Russian crude.Bessent said the duties were introduced in response to India’s purchases of Russian oil, but noted that those imports have fallen significantly. “We put a tariff on India for buying Russian oil. Indian purchases of Russian oil have collapsed,” Bessent said.Also Read | India-EU FTA: Can ‘mother of all trade deals’ offset impact of Trump’s tariffs? Explained While the tariffs remain in place for now, he suggested there could be a route to removing them, describing the outcome as “a check and a huge success.” He made the remarks in an interaction with a US-based publication on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. Bessent also took aim at European nations, accusing them of sourcing refined Russian oil products from India.Meanwhile, India’s approach to sourcing crude oil is increasingly tilting toward supplies that carry lower risk and offer greater certainty of delivery. As part of this shift, Middle Eastern grades have strengthened their position in the import mix, while Russian crude continues to feature but in a more measured manner shaped by compliance and execution considerations.Data from real-time analytics firm Kpler shows that Russian oil imports slipped to about 1.1 million barrels per day during the first three weeks of January, compared with an average of 1.21 million bpd in the previous month and more than 2 million bpd at their peak in mid-2025. With the country meeting nearly 90 per cent of its crude oil requirements through imports, India is once again relying more heavily on its traditional suppliers in the Middle East.More recently, fresh sanctions imposed by the United States on Russian suppliers have slowed buying activity, as concerns over regulatory compliance and logistical execution have intensified. “India’s crude buying in January 2026 shows a clear shift toward lower-risk and more reliable supply, with Middle East barrels rising while Russian crude flows remain present but more selective and compliance-driven,” said Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst for Refining and Modeling at Kpler.Ritolia said India is expected to continue purchasing Russian crude in early 2026, though at levels below the record highs seen between 2023 and 2025."

They noted that the BFSI sector’s market capitalisation has expanded sharply over the past two decades, rising from INR 1.8 trillion in 2005 to INR 9 trillion in 2025, reflecting its growing role in the economy.""Under the current policy, FDI of up to 74 percent is permitted in private sector banks in India, with investments up to 49 percent allowed under the automatic route and any investment beyond this threshold requiring government approval,"" they said. ""Additionally, there are various sub-limits prescribed in the exchange control regulations that apply to FDI in Indian private sector banks,"" the experts further added.However, they pointed out that the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 restricts the voting rights of promoters in private sector banks to 26 per cent of total voting rights, regardless of their shareholding level. This cap applies equally to domestic and foreign investors. "" The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, limits the voting rights of promoters of Indian private sector banks to 26 percent of the total voting rights in a bank, irrespective of their level of ownership in the bank. This voting right restriction applies uniformly to both domestic and foreign investors,"" they also said.According to the experts, this limitation has historically discouraged foreign investors from taking majority or significant minority stakes in Indian banks, thereby limiting the sector’s ability to attract large pools of global capital.“As the Indian economy grows to US 5 trillion by 2028 and US 30 trillion by 2047, it will require large and resilient Indian banks to support this expansion,” they said. “To this effect, it is important for the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, to relook at the 26 per cent voting rights cap and align it with the ownership pattern of the shareholder,"" the experts recommended."

India is rapidly expanding its energy infrastructure, with EV charging stations being installed across highways and cities. CNG stations are growing as part of the City Gas Distribution (CGD) initiative and PM E-Drive Scheme under the Union Budget 2026. While this is progress on paper, the story is much more complicated on the ground.As of today, India has over 29,000 EV charging stations. However, the utilisation rate is still low, ranging from 5% to 25%. On the one hand, many legacy chargers are unreliable or frequently offline due to poor maintenance. On the other hand, CNG stations face long queues, inconsistent demand, and operational challenges despite increased vehicle adoption.The problem doesn’t lie in ambition but in approach. India has prioritised physical infrastructure while underinvesting in the digital systems required to operate these assets efficiently at scale.As we move into 2026, India’s clean energy transition will depend not just on adding more stations but also on integrating digital solutions with the existing physical infrastructure to provide visibility, predictability, and coordination, and that is what we should also expect from the Union Budget 2026.Why does having physical infrastructure without digital intelligence keep us from growing?Energy infrastructure today is no longer just about dispensing fuel or electricity. Every charger, every CNG nozzle, every transformer is a potential data point. When this data is not visible, the system becomes reactive rather than proactive.This leads to a situation known as the “paradox of plenty” in EV charging. This means that the chargers are available, yet users still experience range anxiety. It’s because the users don’t know if the charger is working, whether it’s occupied, how long the wait will be, or whether payment will fail. Parallely, these utilities also face challenges with peak loads and transformer stress due to unpredictable charging demand.Just like EV charging stations have poor visibility for their customers, CNG stations encounter similar challenges. Demand surges at certain times, leading to queues that disrupt traffic and increase safety risks. These issues arise not from lack of capacity, but from insufficient real-time operational intelligence.We have the means to build large-scale physical infrastructure, but we don’t have the real-time information needed to bring these assets together into a single platform. This makes things harder for customers and regulators.It’s time we move EV Charging from just “Plug” to “Smart”To truly expand EV charging under Budget 2026, we need to turn these standalone machines into a connected system. First, real-time visibility is essential. Stations should provide information such as live availability, estimated wait times, and operational status. This can reduce congestion, improve utilisation, and increase user confidence.Second, India needs a unified digital platform. The current fragmented ecosystem of multiple charging point operator (CPO) apps, wallets, and proprietary systems creates friction throughout the process. All the CPOs work independently, and the lack of a shared digital experience makes it difficult for end users to find charging stations in their vicinity.Having a unified digital super app, built under the PM E-Drive framework, could be a positive step toward bringing the EV ecosystem together. Making it easy to find, charge, and pay, no matter the operator, will be key to making EVs as convenient as regular refuelling.Third, smart grid integration should be the norm. Fast chargers draw a lot of power, and without digital coordination, they can overload local transformers during peak hours. Using AI to predict demand and manage loads in real time can keep the grid safe and help it grow.Finally, making interoperability is essential. Even though there are standard protocols like OCPP 1.6, they don’t fully let chargers from different brands connect to central systems. Linking all operators to a shared digital platform could reduce wait times, improve visibility, boost uptime, enable remote checks, and reduce manual fixes that can cause problems. Encouraging operational intelligence at CNG stations could benefit both fuel operators and consumers.According to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, the City Gas Distribution network is expanding rapidly across 784 districts across 34 states and union territories, but scaling without digitalisation could lead to inefficiencies.If we look at the CNG infrastructure today, it resembles the early telecom years' networks: large, capital-intensive, and under-equipped with sufficient sensors, monitoring, or IT tools. But the shift from conventional to digitalised network management is no longer optional today.Queue management is a clear example. In the current scenario, we can expect long lines at CNG stations during peak hours, and it’s not just an inconvenience. It affects traffic flow, emissions, and safety. With access to real-time data on wait and serve times and better resource management, fuel operators can deliver a fast fueling experience during peak demand and improve throughput without adding new physical capacity.Data analytics can also reduce supply challenges by more accurately forecasting consumption patterns. Digital monitoring of pipelines and stations lets operators spot problems sooner, perform maintenance before things break, and follow safety rules more effectively. With these insights, the whole system can run faster and more smoothly, reducing congestion and pollution and improving the user experience.Will integrating digital infrastructure with physical assets deliver higher ROI?The main reason to invest in digital infrastructure is the economic benefit. In the Union Budget 2026, what we need to do is make current assets more reliable and easier to find, which could prove more valuable than building new ones, as it’ll enable remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, and central control, helping cut downtime and costs.Not just this, several other new services that will come with digitalising the EV and CNG systems, such as automated billing, app-based logins, RFID access, remote problem-solving, and performance tracking. These aren’t just added benefits; they are what could make large-scale infrastructure work.That’s why Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for energy is important. Using AI-driven platforms will allow India to build its digital capabilities as quickly as it has built hardware. Projects like the proposed Unified Energy Interface, UPI for the energy sector, show a future where EV chargers, rooftop solar, battery storage, and grids all work together as one system instead of being separate. If we’re able to crack this, we could be looking at a streamlined fueling experience across the nation.Some stations are already using AI-powered technologies, allowing them to understand their operations, predict market demands, and improve performance in real time. The Road AheadIndia’s goals of reaching 30% EV use by 2030 and increasing the use of cleaner fuels like CNG are both ambitious and needed. But we need more than ambition at this stage to achieve this goal. The next step to building a massive infrastructure is to see energy infrastructure as digital first, and physical second. We are definitely adding capacity by setting up new stations, but without the software, we’ll be unable to bring efficiency, build trust, and grow.If we want our clean energy shift to succeed, we need to shift our focus from building more assets to building smarter ones, and start allocating resources to building a digital-first infrastructure under Union Budget 2026.Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the original author and do not represent any of The Times Group or its employees."

""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social. ""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters. South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 114 points, or 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent in early trade, AP reported.The pace of the S&P 500’s climb has accelerated sharply in recent years. It took nearly three years for the index to rise from 4,000 to 5,000, but only about nine months to move from 5,000 to 6,000, a level reached in November 2024. The swift push past 7,000 reflects mounting confidence in US corporate earnings and the economy’s ability to withstand tighter financial conditions.Gains on Wednesday were led by heavyweight technology stocks after Dutch chip equipment maker ASML issued a 2026 revenue forecast that exceeded market expectations, reinforcing confidence in sustained demand linked to artificial intelligence.ASML’s customers have become more optimistic about the medium-term outlook, driven largely by expectations for the “sustainability” of AI-related demand, chief executive Christophe Fouquet said, helping ease concerns that the AI rally could be approaching bubble territory.Nvidia, widely seen as the bellwether of the AI boom, rose 1.2 per cent, making it the single biggest contributor to the S&P 500’s advance. ASML’s US-listed shares were little changed.Elsewhere, stock moves were mixed following fresh earnings updates. Starbucks jumped 4.9 per cent after quarterly revenue beat expectations, aided in part by strong demand for a viral promotional cup, even though profits for the end of 2025 missed estimates.In contrast, Amphenol slid 14.9 per cent despite reporting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue growth, as elevated expectations weighed on the stock after a sharp rally earlier this year.Analysts said companies remain under pressure to deliver robust earnings growth following the market’s record-setting run, with stock prices increasingly vulnerable to any disappointment.In currency markets, the US dollar stabilised, rising about 0.3 per cent against the British pound and Japanese yen, a day after a broader dollar index fell to its weakest level since early 2022.The dollar has generally weakened since President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year, with losses accelerating after renewed tariff threats against parts of Europe earlier this month. Those risks, combined with concerns over US government debt, have periodically prompted global investors to reduce exposure to US assets — a trend often referred to as “Sell America.”In the bond market, Treasury yields were steady ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later in the day. The 10-year yield held at 4.24 per cent. The Fed is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, balancing persistent inflation against growth risks.Commodities remained firm as investors sought safe havens. Gold added another 3.5 per cent to $5,258.50 an ounce, after crossing the $5,000 mark for the first time earlier this week.Overseas markets were mixed. European indices slipped, while Asian stocks posted strong gains. South Korea’s Kospi rose 1.7 per cent to a fresh record, supported by a sharp jump in SK Hynix, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rallied 2.6 per cent."

Forecasters have warned that damage, particularly in areas hit by ice, could be catastrophic and comparable to a hurricane. By mid-morning on Saturday, flight cancellations had dominated departures from several major airports, with Memphis, Oklahoma City and Dallas–Fort Worth among the worst affected. Significant disruption was also reported in Austin, Charlotte and Nashville, while airports in Washington and New York were expected to see conditions worsen as the storm continued. Here is what you need to know:What's next for your travel plans?When airlines anticipate weather-related disruption, they often allow passengers to postpone trips by a few days without paying a change fee. For example, American Airlines is waiving change fees for passengers impacted by the storm and adding extra flights across the country to help travellers reach their destinations once conditions improve.Travellers are advised to search online for their airline’s name along with terms such as “travel alerts” to check for rescheduling offers.In case passengers need to proceed, they should use their airline’s app to confirm whether their flight is still operating before leaving for the airport. Cancellations can be announced hours or even days before departure.Which airports and airlines have been most affected so far?By mid-day Saturday, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines had each cancelled more than 1,000 scheduled Sunday flights, according to FlightAware. Oklahoma’s largest airport suspended all flights on Saturday. Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport saw more than 700 departing flights cancelled and nearly as many arriving flights called off. Disruptions were also reported at airports in Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville and Charlotte, North Carolina.What should you do if your flight is cancelled?Passengers at the airport should speak to a customer service representative. Those at home or in a hotel should contact the airline online or by phone. Travellers are encouraged to research alternative flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Will the airline rebook you on another flight?Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no additional charge, depending on seat availability. However, though most major carriers, say they can rebook passengers on partner airlines, this is not guaranteed.Are you entitled to a refund if your flight is cancelled?Yes. If a flight is cancelled and the passenger no longer wants to travel, or has found another way to reach the destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The reason for the cancellation does not matter.Passengers are entitled to a full ticket refund, as well as refunds for unused baggage fees, seat upgrades or other extras. Airlines may offer travel credits, but passengers are entitled to a cash refund.According to the US Department of Transportation, refunds for credit card payments must be issued within seven business days after a passenger declines an alternative flight or voucher. Refunds for tickets purchased with cash or cheque must be issued within 20 calendar days.Will airlines cover meals or accommodation during delays or cancellations?US airlines are not required to compensate passengers for meals or lodging when flights are cancelled or significantly delayed due to an “uncontrollable” event such as bad weather.How can passengers reach airline support more easily during major disruptions?Customer service phone lines are often overwhelmed during major storms. Travellers can try using priority phone numbers linked to higher frequent-flyer status or calling an airline’s international support number, where agents can often assist with rebooking."

The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction and recovery from the conflict at around $11 billion.Lebanon’s prolonged financial crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement, has left individuals and companies unable to access their own savings trapped in the banking system.Al Habtoor Group operates several assets in Lebanon, including the Metropolitan Palace Hotel in a Beirut suburb and Habtoor Land, a large theme park east of the capital. Last year, the group had reversed earlier plans to dismantle the Metropolitan Palace Hotel.In a statement, the conglomerate said the damage to its assets and properties in Lebanon exceeds $1.7 billion, blaming not only banking restrictions but also the wider political, economic, financial and social crises, as well as the failure of the Lebanese state to provide a stable and secure investment environment.While reiterating that it remains open to “lawful and constructive solutions” that would fully restore its rights, the group said it has exhausted all good-faith efforts to resolve the dispute amicably.“As a result, the group has no other alternative but to advance this matter further and proceed to take all legal measures necessary to protect and enforce its rights under applicable international agreements and legal frameworks,” it said, without specifying where the legal action would be filed.Officials at the Lebanese prime minister’s office were not immediately available for comment.The move comes at a time when Lebanon has been seeking to repair ties with oil-rich Gulf countries after years of strained relations linked to the influence of Hezbollah. The militant group was severely weakened during its latest war with Israel, which ended with a US-brokered ceasefire in November 2024.Lebanon has since installed a new president and prime minister, both of whom have pledged to fight corruption and stabilise the country’s battered economy."

A key uncertainty, it cautioned, is whether crude oil prices could break out of what it described as an “artificially managed supply glut”.Against this backdrop, SBI Research expects nominal GDP growth for Budget calculations at around 10.5–11% in FY27, noting that rising international commodity prices could percolate into wholesale inflation. Based on this, the fiscal deficit is projected at about 4.2% of GDP, although the bank flagged that the new GDP series could alter fiscal arithmetic.“A bit slower nominal growth may hurt tax revenues in FY27, requiring better expenditure planning,” the report said, adding that GST rationalisation and possible reductions in marginal personal income tax rates could help cushion pressures on the tax base.Borrowing pressures, RBI roleOn government borrowing, SBI Research expects net central borrowing at Rs 11.7 trillion in FY27, alongside repayments of Rs 4.87 trillion, while state gross borrowings may rise to Rs 12.6 trillion with repayments of Rs 4.2 trillion.“RBI would need to do much more OMOs to balance the borrowing requirements,” the report said, underlining the growing role of liquidity management as market borrowings expand.Over the medium term, SBI estimates gross market borrowing of Rs 93.8–95.2 lakh crore over the next five fiscals, averaging Rs 18–19 lakh crore annually, significantly higher than the current run rate. This, it said, makes it “imperative that government also looks at borrowings through alternative and enhancing sources like small savings”.Capex to remain the fulcrumPublic investment is expected to remain the centrepiece of the growth strategy. SBI Research said government capital expenditure may cross Rs 12 lakh crore in FY27, implying a year-on-year increase of about 10%.While tax revenues are likely to post only modest growth and non-tax revenues may remain flat, the bank believes continued capex will help sustain domestic demand and crowd in private investment.Debt consolidation and state financesSBI Research also pointed to the Centre’s medium-term fiscal consolidation path, under which central government debt-to-GDP is projected to decline from 57.1% in FY25 to 56.1% in FY26, with an explicit commitment to place debt on a declining trajectory towards about 50% of GDP by March 2031, in the absence of major exogenous shocks.It said a similar framework needs to be institutionalised at the state level, noting that states account for a significant share of general government debt.“State budgets should explicitly chart medium-term, preferably scenario-based, debt-to-GSDP trajectories, aligned with realistic growth assumptions and development needs, rather than relying solely on annual deficit targets,” the report said, adding that this could find emphasis in the Budget speech.Savings, insurance and structural reformsOn taxation, SBI Research pushed reforms to boost household financial savings, including parity in tax treatment of interest on deposits with capital gains, a shorter lock-in for tax-saving fixed deposits, and a higher TDS threshold on savings account interest.The report also called for a “plethora of reforms” in the insurance and pensions sector to improve penetration. It flagged concerns around health insurance claims, citing IRDAI data that showed around 69% of complaints in FY25 were related to claims, and said citizens often struggle to receive timely settlements.With climate risks rising, SBI Research highlighted that India faces a protection gap of nearly 93% for natural disasters between 1991 and 2025, making a strong case for a public–private disaster risk pool involving insurers.It also pushed for a transition to a risk-based capital framework in insurance, moving away from “static, formula-driven, one-size-fits-all solvency margins” to a more dynamic, risk-aligned approach.Despite the turbulence in global markets, SBI Research said India continues to remain the bright spot, supported by strong macro fundamentals. The challenge for Budget 2026–27, it noted, will be to balance fiscal consolidation with growth imperatives while navigating an uncertain global environment."

Will Union Budget 2026 lend some clarity to the crypto framework in India?The Halwa ceremony is now over, final preparations are in place and all eyes are on what Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s red bahikhata is holding for various sectors. Taxpayers, investors and businesses are watching closely, eager to see what the upcoming Union Budget 2026-2027 brings for them. One of the keen audiences to the Budget will be the Cryptocurrency sector, which has been standing at a critical juncture after the Budget 2025.India has emerged as the world’s largest cryptocurrency market, thanks to widespread grassroots adoption and a strong digital payments ecosystem. A large diaspora relying on remittances, young adults using crypto trading as an additional source of income, and seamless fintech infrastructure such as UPI and eRupi have all contributed to the sector’s rapid expansion, according to Chainanalysis.Between July 2024 and June 2025, the on-chain value received in India rose by 99% compared to the previous year. The country now leads the region in on-chain transaction volume and secured the top position across all sub-indices in the 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index.This rapid growth has also created an urgent need for a clear regulatory framework for crypto trading. The formal recognition of virtual digital assets in India’s tax system began with the Union Budget 2022–23, marking the first time these assets were explicitly acknowledged. The government highlighted a “phenomenal increase” in both the volume and frequency of crypto transactions, and introduced a dedicated tax regime that imposed a flat 30% tax on income earned from the transfer of virtual digital assets.“No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income except cost of acquisition. Further, loss from transfer of virtual digital asset cannot be set off against any other income. Further, in order to capture the transaction details, I also propose to provide for TDS on payment made in relation to transfer of virtual digital asset at the rate of 1 per cent of such consideration above a monetary threshold. Gift of virtual digital asset is also proposed to be taxed in the hands of the recipient,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her Union Budget 2022-23 speech. What Budget 2025 unfolded for the crypto world?In last year’s Budget, the Centre spoke of the “Obligation to furnish information in respect of crypto-asset.” While the 30% flat tax on crypto gains and the 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on transactions, were left untouched, the Finance Bill introduced mechanisms that significantly widened the state’s scope to monitor crypto activity. This reporting of crypto assets will be in effect from April 1, 2026.For India’s large number of crypto investors, the message was unambiguous: disclosure is no longer optional.One of the most important measures was the introduction of Section 285BAA, which brought crypto exchanges, wallet providers and intermediaries under a mandatory reporting framework similar to banks and financial institutions. These entities are now required to submit periodic statements of financial transactions to the Income Tax Department, detailing user activity and transaction values.“Sub-section (1) of section 285BAA of the Act states any person, being a reporting entity, as may be prescribed, in respect of crypto asset, shall furnish information in respect of a transaction in such crypto asset in a statement, for such period, within such time, in such form and manner and to such income-tax authority, as may be prescribed,” the Budget document read.A wider net for emerging digital assetsThe government also expanded the definition of VDAs under Section 2(47A), ensuring that any asset based on cryptographically secured distributed ledger technology falls within the tax net. This change future-proofed the law against emerging technologies such as decentralised finance (DeFi) instruments, specialised NFTs and newer token formats that previously existed in regulatory grey zones.Crypto as undisclosed income: A high-stakes shiftPerhaps the sector’s highlight of Budget 2025 was the inclusion of cryptocurrencies within the ambit of search and seizure provisions. For the first time, undisclosed VDAs were explicitly placed on par with unexplained cash, bullion or jewellery.Under the amended provisions, from February 1, 2025, if undisclosed crypto holdings were detected during a tax search, they are subjected to tax at an effective rate of 60%, including surcharge and penalty. This move effectively erased most of the asset’s value. The change dramatically raised the stakes for non-compliance, transforming crypto from a speculative risk into a serious tax liability if left unreported.In short, the Budget 2025 tightened the noose for crypto traders:The 30% flat tax on gains continues, regardless of income slab or holding periodThe 1% TDS remains in place, acting as a transaction-level tracking toolLoss set-off remains prohibited, forcing investors to pay tax on profits while absorbing losses independentlyThe result is a compliance-heavy regime that prioritises tracing the digital asset. Every crypto trade today leaves a digital trail straight to the tax department.But before that, on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting her ninth consecutive Budget in the Parliament. With the regulatory infrastructure now more regulated than before, experts believe Budget 2026 could become a turning point. Tax experts interviewed in a Times of India Online survey have urged the Centre for greater clarity and consistency in cryptocurrency taxation, though expectations of meaningful relief remain mixed. window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";r.style.height=d}}});Here’s what experts are hoping the upcoming Budget 2026 for:Guidelines could enhance predictabilitySurabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India, highlighted that the incoming Budget presents an opportunity to bring much-needed clarity to the taxation of virtual digital assets, especially in areas such as loss treatment, cross-category transactions and compliance processes. “Such guidance would enhance predictability for taxpayers while supporting market development and compliance,” she told TOI.Marwah also cited global practices, countries like the US and UK treat cryptocurrencies within the capital gains framework, allowing loss set-offs similar to other financial assets. Introducing “clear and well-scoped rules” in India, she adds, could help reduce ambiguity without changing the government’s broader policy approach.Resolving grey areasRavi Jain, Partner at Vialto Partners, pointed at the absence of nuanced tax rules emerging as a key pain point. “The absence of clear and nuanced tax rules on crypto assets is a growing concern for investors, exchanges, and tax administrators. While the current framework—anchored around a flat 30% tax and TDS on transfers—has brought crypto into the tax net, it leaves several grey areas unresolved,” the expert told TOI.Issues such as asset classification, treatment of losses and cost-basis calculation continue to remain ambiguous, increasing compliance costs, fuelling litigation and discouraging legitimate participation in the ecosystem. Pointing to the disparity with other asset classes, Jain noted that long-term foreign shares are taxed at 12.5% with loss set-off permitted, while countries such as the US and UK treat cryptocurrencies as capital assets and tax gains based on holding periods.In Budget 2026, he said, the government has an opportunity to shift from a “deterrence-based approach” to a “clarity-driven tax framework,” with clear definitions, capital-gains-aligned treatment and streamlined reporting norms to improve compliance.India’s already at top — but a clearer framework is neededRadhika Viswanathan, executive director at Deloitte India, pointed out that India already ranks among the world’s leading markets for cryptocurrency adoption, but the sector now needs regulatory clarity and tax reforms to regain momentum. “The existing tax framework on virtual digital assets marked by a flat tax rate of 30%, TDS of 1%, no off-setting of losses against gains and lack of regulatory framework has significantly deterred the sector's full potential in terms of trading and market development,” she told TOI.According to her, industry stakeholders are seeking a structured regulatory roadmap in Budget 2026 and are pushing for a review of the 2022 tax measures, including a reduction in TDS to 0.01% and a reassessment of the 30% gains tax to boost investor confidence and revive domestic trading.Clarity on to calculate the incomeParizad Sirwalla, partner and head of Global Mobility Services (Tax) at KPMG in India, said that clarity is specifically needed on the method of computing income from cryptocurrency transactions and the applicable rate of taxation. She explained that a framework which classifies crypto income under the appropriate head such as capital gains or income from other sources, based on factors like transaction nature, volume and taxpayer profile would provide greater certainty to stakeholders. Sirwalla added that some concession in allowing slab-rate taxation, instead of the current flat 30% rate, is also a key expectation across the industry.No relaxation in Budget 2026?Offering a more cautious view, Tanu Gupta, partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP, says cryptocurrencies are currently taxed as virtual digital assets at the highest and most aggressive rates. Given the government’s policy approach, she believes it is unlikely that Budget 2026 will bring any relaxation in crypto taxation. Gupta adds that in cases of interpretational ambiguity, outcomes are more likely to favour the tax department rather than taxpayers, reinforcing the compliance-heavy nature of the current regime.Richa Sawhney, partner of tax at Grant Thornton Bharat, said that the government has consistently emphasised the need for global coordination on cryptocurrency regulation and taxation. While there has been some progress globally, she notes that several concerns remain unresolved. As a result, despite a long wishlist from taxpayers and industry participants, Sawhney cautions that any big tax relief for cryptocurrencies may still be some distance away."

He added that the EU, heavily reliant on trade, needs alternative markets if access to the US becomes more costly.Greer suggested the balance of benefits tilts towards New Delhi. “I've looked at some of the details of the deal so far. I think India comes out on top on this frankly. They get more market access into Europe,” he said. Referring to comments by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on worker mobility, he noted, “It sounds like they have some additional immigration rights. I don't know for sure but President von der Leyen of the EU has talked about mobility for Indian workers into Europe.” He further added: “So I think on net India is going to have a heyday with this. They have low cost labor and it looks like the EU is doubling down on globalization when we're trying to fix some of the problems of globalization here in the US.”India and the EU on Tuesday announced the conclusion of long-running FTA negotiations, a process that began in 2007 and faced years of deadlock over market access, automobiles, wines and spirits, data rules and public procurement. Talks were relaunched in 2022 alongside parallel negotiations on investment protection and geographical indications.Under the deal, India gains preferential access to the EU across 97 per cent of tariff lines, covering 99.5 per cent of trade value. A large share of labour-intensive exports — including textiles, leather, footwear, gems and jewellery, marine products, tea, coffee and spices — will see immediate duty elimination. Goods worth an estimated USD 33 billion that currently face EU duties of 4–26 per cent are set to enter at zero duty once the pact takes effect. Sensitive sectors such as dairy and certain agricultural products have been shielded.For the EU, India is offering concessions on over 92 per cent of tariff lines, with many seeing immediate or phased duty cuts. European exports such as olive oil, processed foods and certain high-technology goods are expected to benefit, while tariffs on wines, spirits and some meats will be reduced.Von der Leyen described the agreement as a decisive moment that sends “a strong signal to the world”, framing it as the foundation of a deeper economic and strategic partnership between the two sides."

The agreement comes at a time when global trade flows have been disrupted by high US tariffs, fragile supply chains and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.India is currently facing steep tariffs from the US, while the EU is also under threat of higher American duties.What the deal coversUnder the FTA, duties will be cut on 99.5% of goods exported from India to the EU, including seafood and footwear. In return, India will reduce or eliminate tariffs on 96.6% of goods imported from the EU, including phased cuts for European carmakers and alcohol producers.Once implemented, the pact will create a combined market of nearly 2 billion people, spanning the world’s fourth-largest economy (India) and the second-largest economic bloc (EU).Indian apparel manufacturers and gems and jewellery exporters are among the biggest gainers, as EU duties on these products will be cut to zero.Domestic food producers will also get preferential access to the European market.However, Indian automakers and liquor companies are expected to face stiffer competition as lower import levies make European products cheaper. As companies await more details, here’s a look at who stands to gain and and who may lose:Big winnersApparel &amp; textilesIndia gains immediate zero-duty access to a $263 billion European textile market. The government said tariffs on textile imports will be eliminated immediately. CareEdge Ratings called the deal ""critical"" for improving competitiveness, estimating India could raise its EU market share to 9% from 5%, adding nearly $4.5 billion in annual exports over the medium term.Textile stocks reacted sharply, with KPR Mill, Welspun Living, and Kitex Garments posting strong gains, Bloomberg reported.Leather &amp; footwearTariffs on leather and footwear have been slashed to zero from 17%, opening up a $100 billion EU market for Indian exporters.Gems &amp; jewelleryThe EU has granted duty-free access to Indian gems and jewellery. Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said bilateral trade could double to Rs 910 billion in the next three years.""This timely pact will help Indian exporters salvage lost ground,"" he said, noting that exports to the US have fallen sharply.Food products &amp; seafoodIndian exporters of shrimp, frozen fish and value-added seafood products will get preferential access to the EU market. Producers of tea, coffee, spices, grapes and processed food will also benefit, while safeguards remain in place for sensitive sectors like dairy and poultry.Benefits for IndiaPreferential access across 97% of tariff lines, covering 99.5% of trade value.Immediate duty elimination for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery.Zero-duty entry for $33 billion worth of exports currently facing EU tariffs of 4–26%.Sensitive sectors like dairy, cereals and poultry are protected.LosersTrade without TrumpThe ""mother of all deals"" comes at a critical moment for the global economy, which has been unsettled by the unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump.The landmark India–EU trade pact is expected to reduce both sides’ dependence on the United States and China.Negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gained momentum after tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.The Trump administration has openly criticised the agreement. Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alleged that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine war by purchasing energy products routed through India.He argued that European countries were weakening their own security by importing refined fuel from India that originates from Russian crude oil, while Washington imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.""We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,"" Bessent said.However, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has dismissed suggestions that US tariffs played a role in pushing the deal forward, saying, ""I don’t think we even discussed this."" Liquor makersIndia has sharply cut tariffs on European alcohol. Duties on wine have been reduced to 20%, spirits to 40% (from as high as 150%), and beer to 50%.This is expected to intensify competition for Indian liquor firms. ""It’s a negative for Indian liquormakers,"" said Karan Taurani of Elara Securities. Shares of Sula Vineyards, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan fell after the announcement.Indian carmakersThe pact allows up to 250,000 European vehicles to enter India at preferential rates, with tariffs gradually dropping from 110% to as low as 10%. Duties on auto components will also be scrapped over 5–10 years.Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles slipped following the news.Why the deal mattersSigned after nearly two decades of negotiations, the agreement marks India’s most ambitious trade pact so far and is set to reshape supply chains, pricing power and growth prospects across sectors. ""Textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, pharma, and high-tech engineering"" will benefit from the deal, Munjal Almoula, managing partner for Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India told Bloomberg.India’s goods trade with the EU stood at $136.5 billion in 2024-25, making the bloc its largest trading partner. The FTA is expected to be signed later this year, following legal vetting and approval by the European Parliament."

Exceptional as his opposition to Trump has been, the billionaire tech savant has set off a political and cultural firestorm this week with a blunt message aimed at MAGA maverick Elon Musk’s workforce: if you are a non-white employee at Tesla, SpaceX or X, you should quit — and come work for him instead.In a viral post on X, Khosla accused Musk of advancing a racially exclusionary version of Trump’s MAGA movement and urged employees who disagreed to walk away. “@elonmusk doesn’t want MAGA, he wants WAGA — ‘white America great again’ — as a ‘racism is great and desirable’ paradigm,” Khosla wrote, responding to Musk’s comments about white people becoming a “rapidly diminishing minority.” Khosla went on to invite “all non-whites… and all decent whites” at Musk’s companies to resign and send their LinkedIn profiles to Khosla Ventures. The extraordinary call — part political denunciation, part talent raid — crystallized Khosla’s position as one of the very few tech titans willing to openly challenge Trump’s growing alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite. While much of the industry – including companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, all led by Indian-Americans – has moved to accommodate, or even embrace, Trump II, Khosla has chosen defiance, framing the moment as a moral test for American capitalism.Musk responded by calling Khosla a “pompous a******” and reminding him that his partner, Shivon, is half Indian and his eldest son with her “is named in honor of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.”The Musk clash did not emerge in isolation. For months, Khosla has used his social media presence to attack Trump’s leadership, values and approach to governance. In January 2026, he described the administration’s agenda as “The Undoing Project,” accusing Trump of orchestrating a “rampant, multifarious attack on American values, norms, institutions, laws, and democracy.” He has warned that fear and cynicism are being used to silence opposition and has repeatedly urged Republicans, executives and investors to speak out.Khosla’s hostility toward Trump is deeply personal as well as political. An immigrant from India and a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, he has argued that Trump’s rhetoric and policies undermine the meritocratic ideals that powered Silicon Valley’s rise. In earlier posts that resurfaced during the 2024 election cycle, Khosla said he despised Trump for his “lack of values, his pathological lying, his selfishness,” accusing him of appealing to “the least appealing parts of American society.”That worldview now puts Khosla sharply at odds with the prevailing direction of the tech industry. A growing cohort of influential “tech bros” has signed up, explicitly or implicitly, for MAGA. Musk stands at the center of that universe, having donated heavily to Trump’s campaign and emerged as the president’s most powerful ally in Silicon Valley. Others in Trump’s orbit include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, investor and podcaster David Sacks, and venture capital heavyweights Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, all of whom have praised Trump’s promises of deregulation, tax cuts and a lighter regulatory touch on artificial intelligence and crypto.Even executives who once positioned themselves as Trump skeptics have largely shifted to pragmatic cooperation. Leaders of Meta (Mark Zuckerberg), Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Apple (Tim Cook), Google (Sundar Pichai), Microsoft (Satya Nadella), and IBM (Arvind Krishna) have attended Trump events, increased political donations and pledged billions in US investments, while tech lobbying has surged to record levels. The calculation is straightforward: access, influence and regulatory relief outweigh ideological discomfort.By contrast, open opposition has become rare. Aside from Khosla, only a handful of prominent figures — including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Mark Cuban — have maintained public distance from Trump. While dozens of top venture capitalists now lean pro-Trump, outspoken critics can be counted on one hand.The divide carries consequences for tech workers, many of whom remain politically liberal even as their employers drift right. Over 450 employees from Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and OpenAI recently signed an open letter demanding their CEOs ""pick up the phone"" to stop ICE excesses. Khosla’s call for non-white employees to leave Musk’s companies is tapping into that tension, highlighting a widening gap between executive power and workforce values. As Trump settles deeper into his second term, Silicon Valley increasingly looks like a sector that has chosen alignment over resistance. Khosla, by contrast, is betting that dissent still matters — even if it leaves him standing nearly alone."

The Forum for Democracy, led by 28-year-old Lidewij de Vos, gained four seats in the 2025 election with a message against ""uncontrolled immigration"" and ""the hopeless EU"".Hard-right party JA21 also shot up the rankings, gaining eight seats and nearly securing a seat at the cabinet table before being blocked by Jetten."
timesofindia,business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-outlook-former-rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-calls-for-long-term-vision-to-build-resilience-sustain-growth/articleshow/127698562.cms,2026-01-28T10:39:00+00:00,"Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday said the upcoming Union Budget should be anchored in a longer-term vision aimed at making the Indian economy more resilient and independent, even as it accelerates growth, warning that the world is passing through an “extremely dangerous time,” according to PTI.In an interview with PTI Videos, Rajan said India needs to move beyond a year-to-year fiscal exercise and integrate the Budget for 2026–27 with a broader strategic roadmap. While India earlier had five-year plans, he noted that budgets were not always well aligned with those longer-term goals.“I think it should be integrated with a longer-term vision. How do we become more resilient, more independent as an economy, but also fast growing, so that everybody else wants to be friends with India,” Rajan said, adding that such an approach would require sustained effort. He said he was hopeful that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s forthcoming Budget, to be presented on February 1, would move in that direction.Rajan said the global and Indian economies are facing heightened risks, even as new opportunities emerge from large investments in artificial intelligence. “We are seeing lots of positive opportunities from the tremendous investment in AI,” he said, but cautioned that excessive dependence on a narrow set of external partners could leave India vulnerable. He pointed out that India lacks a nearby, wealthy natural market other than its own, underscoring the need for careful economic positioning.The former RBI governor, who is currently the Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said he understood that the Budget may involve cutting certain tariff rates that currently hinder India’s integration into global supply chains. He added that while states have begun adopting more investment-friendly policies, more needs to be done.While describing India as the fastest-growing large economy—a fact he said should be celebrated—Rajan stressed the importance of building a wider set of economic relationships. “We also need to make as many sorts of relationships as we can, including with our neighbours, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal,” he said.Asked how India should respond if trade tensions with the United States escalate further, Rajan said the priority should be to temporarily tune out external noise and focus inward on reforms that can lift the growth trajectory. He recalled that India undertook a series of major reforms in the 1990s and early 2000s, followed by a period of relative slowdown on that front.“I think it is time to start that process again,” he said, while acknowledging that the Narendra Modi government has implemented several reforms in recent years. According to Rajan, the focus now should be on identifying measures that can add two percentage points or more to India’s growth rate.Rajan said the current global uncertainty, driven in part by policy shifts among major powers, has created an opportunity for India to reinsert itself into global supply chains. However, he noted that India is not naturally embedded in such chains, given its geography and the fact that its only large neighbour is China, with which it has a border dispute.“It would be important for India going forward to diversify across the supply chains that it has access to, including with China, but also importantly, with Europe, with Australia, with Canada, with the Middle East, as also with the East Asian countries,” he said.He added that India may have missed earlier opportunities but now has a fresh chance to catch up. “It is not just manufacturing, it is services, and it is all kinds of services,” Rajan said, asking whether India can start thinking more systematically about expanding its presence in these areas. If accompanied by credible reforms, he said, this could attract more foreign direct investment and deepen India’s integration with global supply chains.The comments come against the backdrop of strained India–US trade ties, after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% levy linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.On whether India should aspire to sustain growth rates of 8–9% over long periods, as China and some East Asian economies did, Rajan said India need not follow the same “helter-skelter” path. He argued that some of China’s rapid growth was unsustainable, citing ongoing problems in its property market.Rajan also flagged concerns about the quality of growth in India, particularly in infrastructure. “Every city seems to want a metro, but not every city has the ability to put metro stations in the right place,” he said, warning that some investments may prove difficult to recover over time. He stressed that public infrastructure should be built only where it can be effectively used.Emphasising the need for sustainable growth, Rajan said policymakers must be cautious about investments that generate only short-term momentum. This includes housing, he said, noting that not all housing projects, even in a country with significant unmet demand, can be utilised effectively. “We have to be careful about helter-skelter growth,” he said."

The two countries have agreed to start afresh on the proposed pact, with officials noting that the global trade landscape has changed significantly over the past two years, warranting a renewed approach. “Canada has expressed its desire to speed up the FTA negotiations,” the official said.Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal said earlier this month that India and Canada are in the process of finalising the terms of reference (ToR) to formally kick off negotiations. The ToR will set out the scope and modalities of the proposed agreement.Both sides have appointed their chief negotiators. Brij Mohan Mishra, Joint Secretary in the Department of Commerce, will lead negotiations for India, while Bruce Christie has been named Canada’s chief negotiator.Bilateral trade data show India’s exports to Canada rose 9.8 per cent to $4.22 billion in 2024–25, up from $3.84 billion in 2023–24. Imports from Canada dipped 2.33 per cent to $4.44 billion last fiscal year, compared with $4.55 billion a year earlier."

The remarks come a day after India and the European Union sealed a landmark free trade agreement, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top EU leadership unveiling a five-year agenda aimed at expanding trade and defence cooperation as part of a broader push to protect a rules-based global order.Meanwhile, PM Modi described the India-EU pact as ""historic"", saying it would accelerate the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign, strengthen the resolve of 'Make in India, Make for the World', and open ""countless opportunities"" for India’s youth.Addressing the annual National Cadet Corps (NCC) PM rally in Delhi, PM Modi said the world was describing the agreement as the ""mother of all deals"" and a ""game-changer"", asserting it would mean ""freedom to aspire"" for young Indians. He said sectors in the creative economy including film, gaming, fashion, digital content, music and design were expected to gain from the deal, along with research, education, IT and other professional services.The India-EU FTA is expected to create a market of nearly two billion people, representing around one-fourth of global GDP and one-third of world trade. As part of the summit, the two sides also signed pacts on security and defence collaboration and mobility of Indian talent to Europe.PM Modi said tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports to the EU would be eliminated or reduced significantly, benefiting sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, footwear and engineering goods. He said the pact would provide weavers, artisans, MSMEs and small entrepreneurs direct access to EU markets.The agreement is also expected to boost investment into India and lead to new manufacturing capacity in areas like engineering, electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, while creating stronger markets for agriculture, food processing and fisheries, Modi said. He added that the pact could open up job opportunities for Indian youth in 27 EU countries, particularly in engineering, green technology, design, logistics and advanced manufacturing.EU members include France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Belgium and Denmark among others."

The veteran leader of Nationalist Congress Party, died in a plane crash on Wednesday morning in Baramati.Along with Pawar, his personal security officer, an aide, and two crew members comprising the pilot in command and the first officer lost their lives in the incident. Pawar is survived by his wife Sunetra, a Rajya Sabha member, and their two sons, Parth and Jay.Following the tragedy, the Maharashtra government announced a public holiday on Wednesday and declared three days of state mourning.Are banks closed in Maharashtra tomorrow?There is no official notification of banks being closed in Maharashtra as part of the mourning declared in the state. However, it is always advisable to call and check at your bank before heading to the branch.Bank holidays are pre-decided as per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI’s) calendar. In the month of January 2026, banks in Maharashtra have been closed on two occasions: January 15 for the municipal elections, and on January 26 in observance of the Republic Day.In February, banks in Maharashtra will be closed only on February 19, for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti. This is apart from the second and fourth Saturdays and Sundays.Meanwhile, banking activities at branches across several parts of the country, including cheque clearing as well as cash deposits and withdrawals, were disrupted on Tuesday after the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) went on a nationwide strike to press for the immediate rollout of a five-day work week for bank employees.The protest was called after a conciliation meeting with the Chief Labour Commissioner on January 23 failed to produce a breakthrough. UFBU represents nine unions comprising officers and employees of banks, and close to eight lakh staff members from public sector banks joined the strike action.As a result, cheque clearances amounting to nearly Rs 4 lakh crore were stalled, while cash transactions also suffered. Operations such as bill trading, bill discounting and treasury functions were suspended at many public sector banks, All India Bank Employees Association general secretary C H Venkatachalam, whose union is part of UFBU, told PTI.All India Bank Officers’ Confederation General Secretary Rupam Roy said that discussions held in December 2023 had resulted in an understanding to extend weekday working hours by 40 minutes from Monday to Friday, with the remaining Saturdays to be treated as holidays.

Spending rose from Rs 4.85 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 6.41 lakh crore in FY25 (Revised Estimates). For FY26, the Budget Estimates place defence expenditure at Rs 6.81 lakh crore. This reflects a consistent annual increase, underlining the government’s priority on national security and preparedness.window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";r.style.height=d}}});The data shows defence spending has grown by nearly Rs 2 lakh crore since FY21, with sharper increases in recent years as border tensions and global conflicts reshaped security calculations.Shift towards modernisation and capital spendThe rising allocations have increasingly been aligned with modernisation and capital expenditure. As per the PIB release on Budget 2025-26, Rs 1.80 lakh crore, or about 26% of the total defence outlay, was earmarked for capital expenditure, with a strong push for domestic procurement under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. A significant share of the modernisation budget has been reserved for procurement from Indian industries, including private players.Industry body FICCI, in its pre-Budget 2026 memorandum, has argued that this trend needs to deepen further, calling for capital outlay to be raised to around 30% of the total defence budget. According to FICCI, future warfare will be “technology-driven, multi-domain and information-centric,” requiring investments beyond traditional platforms.Budget 2026 expectations: technology, R&amp;D and exportsWith defence spending already on a rising path, Budget 2026 is expected to focus on qualitative upgrades rather than just headline increases. FICCI has pitched for higher allocations for defence R&D, including a Rs 10,000 crore increase for DRDO, and greater support for AI-enabled systems, UAVs, cyber and space capabilities.Defence exports are another priority area. Exports have grown at a compound annual rate of 46% between 2016-17 and 2023-24, driven largely by private firms, and the government has set a target of Rs 50,000 crore by 2028-29. Analysts say the upcoming Budget will indicate whether India’s steadily rising defence spending can translate into sustained self-reliance and global competitiveness."
timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/from-academic-debate-to-institutional-scrutiny-inside-iit-delhis-caste-conference-fallout/articleshow/127630821.cms,2026-01-27T14:31:00+00:00,"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi has set up a fact-finding committee and sought explanations from faculty organisers after an academic conference on caste and race drew sustained criticism and escalated into a question of institutional judgment rather than academic disagreement.The conference, Critical Philosophy of Caste and Race, was held from January 16 to 18 and organised by the Critical Philosophy of Caste and Race (CPCR) research study group under IIT Delhi’s Department of Humanities and Social Sciences. In another time, it may have passed with limited notice. This time, it did not.What altered the course of events was the way one part of the programme came to be read and then publicly contested outside academic spaces.Concerns gathered around a session that drew a parallel between caste-based marginalisation in India and the Palestinian condition. As one widely circulated post put it, the question being posed was “What is common between Dalits and Palestinians?”The phrasing triggered unease well beyond campus, with critics arguing that such a comparison moved from scholarly exploration into overt political signalling, particularly sensitive amid the current geopolitical climate.That objection did not remain abstract. It hardened into a more pointed institutional question: Whether a nationally symbolic technical institute should be hosting discourse that can be read as aligning domestic social questions with global political conflicts.Once that frame took hold, the conference was no longer being evaluated on academic grounds alone.A response framed as governance, not ideologyAs criticism intensified, IIT Delhi chose to respond publicly. In an X post (formerly Twitter), the institute said: “Serious concerns have been raised over the choice of speakers and content of the ‘Critical Philosophy of Caste and Race’ conference held from January 16 to 18.” It added that the institute had “sought an explanation from the concerned faculty” and that “a fact-finding committee with independent members has been constituted to investigate the concerns.” The same post went on to state that “appropriate actions will be initiated in accordance with institutional protocols, based on the committee’s findings,” while reaffirming the institute’s commitment to academic integrity and national goals. The phrasing matters. IIT Delhi did not defend the conference. Nor did it condemn it. Instead, it relocated the issue to process: Speaker selection, approvals, and oversight. This is a familiar institutional manoeuvre: When ideas become politically combustible, process becomes the safest ground to stand on.When organisers become part of the storyAttention also turned to the organisers. Divya Dwivedi, Associate Professor, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Delhi, was among those associated with the conference. Her earlier public commentary on caste, Hinduism and politics — which has previously drawn public controversy — meant the event was read by critics in continuity with that broader public record rather than as a standalone academic exerciseIn controversies of this nature, academic intent is often overtaken by accumulated context. Organisers are no longer read as neutral convenors, they are seen as carriers of argument. Once that happens, events they host are interpreted less as open inquiry and more as institutional endorsement. That shift explains why the debate moved so quickly from what was discussed to who allowed it.The language that changed the stakesThe issue took on a different gravity when it was articulated in explicitly political terms. In an X post, former CBI Director M. Nageswara Rao accused the research group of engaging in “anti-national and destabilising activities” and demanded that it be disbanded. Questioning the institute’s leadership, he suggested that the inquiry announced was insufficient and narrowly framed. With that intervention, the controversy crossed a threshold. Allegations of imbalance or ideological bias are one thing; accusations framed around national stability are another. At that point, institutional inaction itself begins to look like risk. The fact-finding committee, already announced, acquired a new role: Not merely to inquire, but to protect.What is actually under examinationOfficially, IIT Delhi has said the committee has been constituted after “serious concerns” were raised over the choice of speakers and content of the conference, and that it will “investigate the concerns” before “appropriate actions” are taken under institutional protocols. The institute has not spelt out the committee’s terms of reference beyond that. But a fact-finding exercise of this kind typically turns on administration, not ideology: Whether the correct internal processes were followed, what approvals were in place, and how responsibility is assigned when an event hosted under an institute’s banner becomes a reputational and governance issue.These are not arguments about caste theory or comparative frameworks of oppression. They are questions about institutional control, the rules that decide what can be hosted, how it is cleared, and who is accountable. The outcome, therefore, is unlikely to be a judgment on ideas. It is more likely to be a tightening of guardrails: clearer process, more explicit oversight, and a more cautious operating template for future events.The boundary IIT Delhi is now negotiatingThe committee’s findings are unlikely to settle wider debates on caste, race or comparative frameworks of discrimination. What they will shape instead is the operating logic of universities like IIT Delhi when academic work attracts political interpretation. The episode illustrates how questions of caste — especially when framed in ways that travel beyond domestic contexts — quickly shift from scholarship to governance. The consequence is not an overt narrowing of academic freedom, but a subtler recalibration: more emphasis on approvals, clearer lines of accountability, and a higher sensitivity to how campus discourse is read outside academic settings. For institutions, the lesson is not about what may be studied, but how visibly and under what institutional safeguards it can be hosted.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

According to the directive, all candidates must enter the exam centre one hour before the scheduled start time, and the main gate will be closed half an hour before the examination begins.Strict Rules to Prevent MalpracticeThe Board made it clear that any attempt to bypass this rule—whether by “jumping over the boundary wall or by forcibly and illegally entering the gate”—will be treated as criminal trespass. Such acts, BSEB said, amount to “a clear attempt to affect the purity of the malpractice-free examination and a criminal act.”The punishment is strict. Any candidate caught entering illegally after gate closure will be expelled from the examination for two years, and an FIR will be registered against them. But the action doesn’t stop with students. In a significant move to enforce accountability, the Board announced that the centre superintendent who allows such candidates to appear in the examination will be suspended, and legal action will also be initiated against them and other identified officials.Zero Tolerance for Latecomers and ViolationsWith this order, the BSEB appears determined to clamp down hard on last-minute chaos and reinforce discipline during one of the state’s most important examinations.

That if you follow your passion closely enough, Mondays will stop hurting and inboxes will stop overflowing.And we have always searched for that one career that might not look like work. And more often we have heard that “do what you love, you will never work a day in your life.” It bestows a rosy picture, however, the real image is a bit murkier. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and Blue Origin, offers a more grounded perspective. Speaking at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit, he gave a candid glimpse into his daily grind, even after stepping down as CEO.He said, ""I work from about 9 to 7 in meetings. And then I have a bunch of documents I read outside that."" He added, ""You can't start a company unless you're willing to work really hard. And not all the work is fun. That's why they call it work.""Even someone who built a trillion-dollar empire acknowledges a truth many professionals avoid: Work is work. Not every task will feel thrilling, and that’s normal.Half fun is already successBezos doesn’t sugarcoat the challenge. He explains that expecting 100% enjoyment sets people up for disappointment. ""If you get half your job to be fun, you're crushing it,"" he said. The insight is simple: learning to find satisfaction in parts of your work, and accepting the rest, is a key to longevity in any career.Gallup’s 2025 global workplace report highlights that only 21% of employees worldwide feel engaged at work. Stress and disconnection are surging. Unrealistic expectations leave many talented professionals frustrated, overworked, and burned out.Why so many people feel stuckThe perspective can sting more as the modern workforce is burnt out. Gallup’s 2025 global workplace report highlights that only 21% of employees worldwide feel engaged at work. Stress and disconnection are surging. Unrealistic expectations leave many talented professionals frustrated and overworked. Behind those numbers are people who entered their careers expecting fulfillment and found themselves buried under deadlines instead. The disconnect often isn’t about workload alone. It’s about expectations.When people assume work should always feel meaningful, every difficult day feels like failure. But struggle isn’t a sign you chose the wrong path. More often, it’s proof you’re doing something that requires effort.What professionals actually need to learnThe real lesson from Bezos isn’t about grinding harder. It’s about growing wiser. First, stop measuring your career by daily happiness. Some days will feel productive. Others will feel pointless. That’s normal. Progress happens over years, not afternoons.Second, learn to separate purpose from pleasure. Meaning doesn’t always feel good in the moment. Teaching, building, leading, creating, these things are deeply fulfilling, but rarely easy while you’re in the middle of them.Third, develop stamina. Careers are marathons disguised as sprints. The people who last aren’t the most inspired, they’re the most consistent.And finally, understand that boring work often funds meaningful freedom. The unglamorous hours today can create choices tomorrow.Redefining what “loving your job” really meansLoving your job doesn’t mean enjoying every task. It means believing the difficult parts are worth enduring. It means finding value in progress, not perfection. It means staying when things get uncomfortable instead of assuming something better must exist elsewhere.Bezos’ journey, from a garage startup to a global empire, reminds us that success isn’t powered by constant motivation. It’s built on patience, resilience, and a willingness to do work that doesn’t always sparkle.In a world obsessed with passion, this may be the most honest career advice there is: you won’t love every minute. And that’s exactly how real work gets done.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"

For many senior professionals, it has done the opposite. Longer days, blurred boundaries and a sense of being behind at both work and home are now common outcomes of schedules with few fixed edges.This pattern shows up repeatedly in leadership coaching and in research associated with Harvard Business School and Harvard-affiliated studies on work design and burnout. The core problem is not flexibility itself, but how it is used.When flexibility expands work instead of containing itLeaders with control over their schedules often compress family time into the middle of the day and push focused work into late nights and early mornings. The result is more hours worked, poorer sleep and reduced presence at home. Over time, this leads to exhaustion rather than balance.Harvard-backed research on role overload suggests that when work lacks clear limits, people respond by trying to do everything. That effort rarely succeeds. Instead, it creates constant switching between roles and a feeling of falling short everywhere.Define what is enoughOne consistent finding from Harvard research on goal setting is that vague standards raise stress. Leaders who do not define what is enough for work and family tend to chase moving targets.Setting clear work hours, even within a flexible system, helps contain work. Deciding which family commitments matter most and which can be skipped reduces guilt. This approach does not eliminate trade-offs, but it makes them deliberate rather than reactive.Focus on where your work matters mostStudies on senior leadership effectiveness show that value creation narrows as responsibility increases. Not every meeting or request deserves equal time.Leaders who reduce burnout are often those who audit their calendars. They decline meetings that do not require their presence, delegate attendance and reserve daytime hours for work that only they can do. This allows work to happen during normal hours instead of spilling into nights and weekends.Accept short-term discomfort to protect long-term balanceHarvard research on boundaries highlights a difficult truth. Saying no creates friction. Avoiding that friction creates burnout.Leaders who protect their time often disappoint others in the short term by delaying responses or setting limits on availability. Over time, those limits produce clearer thinking, better decisions and more reliable presence at work and at home.Separate being on from being offConstant availability keeps the mind partially at work even during rest. Research on recovery shows that real breaks require full disengagement.Simple rules help. Phones out of reach during family time. No email during defined hours. Vacations without check-ins except for true emergencies. These practices restore attention and reduce fatigue.Flexible work can support a full life, but only when paired with structure. Without it, flexibility expands to fill every hour available. Balance returns when leaders decide, in advance, where work ends and life begins.Ready to navigate global policies?

The directive affects foreign workers seeking specialised roles at taxpayer-funded institutions across the state.Abbott, in conversation with conservative radio host Mark Davis, said the state is seeking detailed visa information from public universities and agencies before issuing an “action plan” for hiring international employees. He stated, “I don’t see any reason why we need any H-1B visa employees in our public schools in the state of Texas. But we’re going to find out if there’s some unique skill set or whatever the case may be,” The Texas Tribune reports.The freeze is part of a broader effort to ensure that positions funded with taxpayer dollars are prioritised for qualified Texans. Abbott told The Texas Tribune that agencies and universities must provide detailed reports to the Texas Workforce Commission, including the number of new or renewed H-1B petitions filed in 2025, the number of visa holders currently sponsored, job titles, countries of origin, and visa expiration dates. Institutions are also required to show efforts to provide Texans with a reasonable opportunity to apply for positions currently held by H-1B visa holders.State universities comply with H-1B freezeTexas A&M University System confirmed that it has already discontinued sponsoring new H-1B visa petitions requiring the $100,000 federal fee imposed by President Trump, The Texas Tribune reports. Chris Bryan, vice chancellor for marketing and communications, told The Texas Tribune, “We have received Governor Abbott’s directive ordering a freeze on new H-1B visa petitions at Texas public institutions of higher education, and we are fully complying with that directive.”The University of Texas System and its 13 institutions have submitted their H-1B visa information to Abbott’s office, Randa Safady, vice chancellor for external relations, communications and advancement services, told The Texas Tribune. “The institutions are complying with the Governor’s directive by freezing new H-1B applications and will await further guidance on how the submission of requests to the Texas Workforce Commission for future hires may work,” she said.Visa expenditures and hiring dataEmails obtained by The Texas Tribune show that Abbott’s office asked Texas A&M University System leaders for detailed data on employees working under H-1B visas. The request followed reporting by the Dallas Express, which had filed a complaint with the Texas attorney general after seeking public records for months. Texas A&M reportedly spent about $3.25 million on H-1B visa sponsorships over roughly five years, while the University of Texas at Dallas spent about $1.1 million during a similar period, The Texas Tribune reports.Federal data cited by The Texas Tribune show that Dallas ISD employs 230 H-1B visa holders, the highest of any education-related employer in Texas, followed by UT Southwestern Medical Center with 220 and Texas A&M University with 210. Other major employers include UT MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Texas at Austin.Impact on international workers and specialised rolesH-1B visas allow employers to hire foreign workers for specialised positions that require at least a bachelor’s degree. Universities and academic medical centres often use the visas to employ professors, researchers, doctors, and other highly trained staff. Miriam Feldblum, co-founder and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, told The Texas Tribune that recent federal policies, including the $100,000 fee, already challenge the competitiveness of US universities.Abbott suggested that some visa holders may have been admitted under previous administrations and could have overstayed. “Those, again, are the type of people that the Trump administration is trying to remove,” he told The Texas Tribune.Texas joins other states in H-1B scrutinyTexas is not the only state monitoring H-1B usage in public institutions. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year directed the state’s public university system to curb H-1B employment, arguing universities were misusing the program and that US citizens should be prioritised. The Florida Board of Governors is considering a proposal to pause new H-1B hires through early 2027, The Texas Tribune reports.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

But newly uncovered internal documents, reported by NBC News, suggest a far more calculated strategy unfolding behind the scenes. The records reveal that Google viewed its expanding footprint in schools not merely as an educational mission but as a long-term business investment, one designed to familiarise children with its ecosystem early and convert them into loyal users for life.However, the documents also point out the possible dangers of Google’s services. For example, YouTube is found to be “problematic for students” because of its dangerous content, advertisements, and comments, as well as its effect on sleep. Nevertheless, the benefit of schools using Google’s services is still emphasized in the presentation, as in this 2020 slide: “You get that loyalty early, and potentially for life.” These findings contradict the notion that schools are a neutral ground for education, as they are now a playing field for corporate politics.YouTube’s risks in the classroomNBC News reported that the internal Google presentations from 2018 to 2024 acknowledged that YouTube could be unsafe and distracting for students. The survey respondents mentioned in the documents said that the platform had a negative impact on their sleep and health. However, despite these issues, the company was still looking for ways to boost engagement, such as by adding YouTube videos to educational content, which was not standardized across US school districts.A pipeline of future usersThe documents describe a clear commercial motivation behind Google’s presence in American schools. One slide asked staff to imagine a world where “Parents ask their children, ‘Why aren’t you watching more YouTube?’” and “School Administrators shift budgets from textbooks to YouTube subscriptions.” Experts cited by NBC News, including cognitive neuroscientist Jared Cooney Horvath, emphasized that such strategies highlight how companies may prioritize long-term customer loyalty over genuine educational outcomes.Legal and ethical questionsThe filings were part of a larger lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, involving families, school districts, and state attorneys general. Plaintiffs claim that Google, together with Meta, ByteDance, and Snap, marketed addictive social media and digital services to children without sufficient warning to schools about the risks. Snap has recently settled its claim, while trials for the remaining companies will seek to determine if they had a legal or moral obligation to limit use or implement safeguards for minors.Google has denied wrongdoing. In a statement to NBC News, a spokesperson said that the documents “mischaracterize our work” and emphasized that schools control platform usage and parental consent is required for students under 18. The company also stated that YouTube content provided to schools is aligned with curriculum needs.Google’s dominance in educationSince the launch of Chromebooks in 2011, Google has become the leading technology provider for schools in the United States. According to market research cited by NBC News, schools now account for approximately 80% of all Chromebook purchases, and over half of American public school students use Google applications for classwork. Yet internal documents show that YouTube remains challenging to use effectively for learning, often directing students to unrelated or inappropriate content. One slide described a search for “linear equations” being recommended a comedy sketch by a user named “cocksandballs123.”The debate over digital learning According to NBC News, education specialists and parent advocates argue that schools often adopt untested digital tools at the expense of proven analog learning methods. Advocates of educational technology counter that, when used responsibly, digital tools can enhance learning outcomes, highlighting a persistent tension in US education policy.The need for accountabilityThe upcoming trial in a Kentucky school district, set for June, may test whether companies like Google are legally responsible for the risks posed by their platforms in schools. According to advocates, the documents reveal that children are being socialized into a commercial ecosystem before they are able to make informed decisions, which raises profound ethical and psychological issues. According to NBC News, this is part of a larger conversation taking place in the country about whether schools are prioritizing learning or inadvertently serving corporate interests.Ready to navigate global policies?

Economics can seem lengthy, but it becomes manageable once the concepts are clear. The subject is less about memorising definitions and more about understanding how the economy works in real life. Since the paper includes theory questions, numericals, diagrams, and application-based answers, regular practice and clear presentation are essential. Teachers say that a calm approach, strong basics, and consistent revision can help students handle the exam with confidence.Economics is also an important subject from a career point of view. It builds a strong foundation for courses in economics, commerce, management, public policy, finance, and civil services. With the right strategy and regular practice, scoring well in Economics is very achievable.Important topics to revise for CBSE Class 12 EconomicsMs. Ambika Jain, PGT Economics, Uttam School for Girls, explains that Economics should be studied with understanding rather than memorisation. She says, “Economics is not about memorization—it is about understanding how concepts operate in real life and influence our decisions and national outcomes.”For Class 12 Macroeconomics, Jain recommends that students concentrate on National Income and Related Aggregates, Money and Banking, Determination of Income and Employment, Government Budget and the Economy, and Balance of Payments. Jain emphasizes the need to be clear on definitions, diagrams, and numericals, and to avoid pitfalls such as confusion between stock and flow concepts or missing labels and units.For Indian Economic Development, she suggests that the topics Indian Economy (1950-1990), Economic Reforms since 1991, Human Capital Formation, Rural Development, Employment, Infrastructure, Environment and Sustainable Development, and Comparative Development should be rewritten. Rather than memorizing facts, she suggests emphasizing causes, impact, and relevance.Himani Sarin Arora, Economics Faculty Member, Mamta Modern School, Vikaspuri, further adds that students are required to refer to and apply the concepts of National Income Accounting, Money and Banking, Government Budget, Balance of Payments, Rural Development, Human Capital Formation, and Environment and Sustainable Development, as these are generally the concepts on which case study and application-based questions are asked.Link theory with real-life economic eventsThis tip is all about making answers more meaningful and relevant. Jain suggests that students should link what they are learning in their textbooks with what is happening in the economy around them. She says, “Use NCERT examples and link answers to current economic trends like inflation, budget announcements, or RBI policy decisions to make responses more meaningful.”Using such links helps students write better application-based answers and also shows conceptual understanding, which examiners appreciate.Focus on concept clarity, not rote learningUnderstanding “why” something happens is more important than memorising definitions. Arora explains, “The secret to scoring high in Economics is concept clarity; don’t just learn what happens — understand why it happens.”She adds that regular revision, practising previous years’ papers, staying confident, and keeping answers organised can make a big difference. She reminds students, “A calm, clear mind and well-organized answers can make all the difference.”Practise CBSE sample papers and previous year questionsThis tip is about building speed and confidence. Mamta Chauhan, SGPGT (Economics), DAV Public School, Pushpanjali Enclave, strongly recommends solving past papers. She says, “Solve previous year CBSE papers and sample papers. This is one of the most effective ways to prepare.”Solving these papers will help the students understand the pattern of the exam, types of questions, and time management.Use proper structure, diagrams, and keywordsPresentation is a very important aspect in scoring well. Ruhani Matta, HOD Economics, ITL Public School, Dwarka, New Delhi, emphasizes the need for proper structure. She advises, “Always use clear headings and subheadings. For 6-mark questions, give a proper introduction and conclusion.”She also emphasizes the use of visuals and terms, stating that graphs and diagrams should be drawn wherever possible and that students should use economic terms that match the CBSE marking scheme.Common mistakes to avoid in CBSE Class 12 EconomicsTeachers say many students lose easy marks because of small, avoidable mistakes. Arora says that students tend to memorize terms without understanding them. Some students tend to draw diagrams incorrectly or forget to label them, while others tend to miss steps or units in numerical questions. Time management is also a problem. She recommends practicing complete question papers in the allotted time and writing answers in an organized manner with headings and underlining key terms.Chauhan further adds that sometimes students misunderstand the question and answer something else. Whenever a question contains a diagram or a number, it should be explained properly with a proper diagram or schedule, according to Chauhan. She also advises the students to remain within the word limit and try to complete the paper section by section in the correct order.Final preparation strategy for CBSE Class 12 Economics 2026According to teachers, to succeed in Economics, one needs to have clear concepts, practice regularly, and present things clearly. By thoroughly revising NCERT, practicing diagrams and number problems, solving sample papers, and keeping calm during exams, students can perform confidently.By putting in the right amount of effort and following the right strategy, students can not only perform well in CBSE Class 12 Economics but also lay a strong foundation for their future.Ready to navigate global policies?

timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/learning-with-toi/why-albert-einstein-never-received-a-nobel-prize-for-relativity/articleshow/127554627.cms,2026-01-26T13:49:00+00:00,"When students learn that Albert Einstein won a Nobel Prize, the assumption feels automatic: relativity. The bending of space and time. The theory that redefined gravity and reshaped modern physics. The idea that turned Einstein’s name into shorthand for genius itself. That assumption is wrong.Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1921, but the Nobel citation carefully avoided any mention of relativity. Instead, it credited him “especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” The prize itself was announced only in 1922, a year late. And the omission was deliberate. It revealed not a failure to recognise brilliance, but a deep institutional hesitation about how scientific revolutions are judged.Nobel’s rules and the burden of proofThe starting point lies with Alfred Nobel. Nobel’s will instructed that prizes be awarded for discoveries conferring “the greatest benefit to humankind.” Over time, Nobel committees interpreted this cautiously. Preference tilted towards work that was experimentally verified, demonstrable, and defensible before sceptical peers. Relativity strained that framework.Einstein’s special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915) were radical reconceptions of time, space, and gravity. They relied heavily on mathematics and thought experiments rather than laboratory apparatus. To many Nobel committee members—steeped in experimental traditions—this made relativity conceptually dazzling but institutionally uncomfortable.The question was not whether Einstein was brilliant. It was whether relativity had crossed the threshold from audacious theory to settled discovery.The eclipse that made headlines and doubtsIn 1919, expeditions led by Arthur Eddington measured the bending of starlight during a solar eclipse, a key prediction of general relativity. Newspapers declared a scientific revolution. Einstein became internationally famous almost overnight.Inside the Nobel system, enthusiasm did not translate into closure. Some physicists questioned whether the measurements were precise enough. Others argued that the confirmation depended too heavily on interpretation rather than repeatable experimental control. Eclipse observations, after all, were rare events—not laboratory routines. Relativity had gained public glory, but it had not yet achieved institutional comfort.The freeze of 1921By 1921, Einstein had been nominated multiple times. Yet the Nobel Committee and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences made an unusual decision: No Physics Prize would be awarded that year. Formally, the prize was “reserved” under Nobel statutes, signalling unresolved disagreement.This was not a rebuke of Einstein. It was a sign of caution. Awarding the prize for relativity would have required the committee to endorse a theoretical revolution some of its most influential evaluators still doubted.The compromise: Honour the certain EinsteinA solution emerged that allowed recognition without risk. Long before relativity made him famous, Einstein had explained the photoelectric effect—how light ejects electrons from metal surfaces. Published in 1905, the work was experimentally confirmed and foundational to emerging technologies, from light sensors to early electronics.It was physics the committee could defend: measurable, repeatable, and aligned with Nobel’s mandate.Thus, when Einstein finally received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922, the citation focused on the photoelectric effect. Relativity—the idea that had changed physics—remained outside the official wording.Einstein’s quiet rebuttalThe final irony arrived later. When Einstein delivered his Nobel lecture in 1923, he did not speak about the photoelectric effect. He spoke about relativity. Without protest or confrontation, he reclaimed the intellectual centre of his work. The committee had drawn boundaries on paper; Einstein redrew them in speech.What this episode really teachesThis was never a story of neglect or injustice. It was a story about how institutions respond to ideas that move faster than consensus. The Nobel Committee did not deny Einstein’s importance. It hesitated to canonise a theory before it felt settled.History, however, was less cautious. Relativity became foundational. Modern physics absorbed it. Satellites corrected for it. Cosmology was rebuilt around it.The deeper lesson for students lies here: Scientific truth does not arrive with instant institutional endorsement. It negotiates its way into acceptance—through evidence, debate, resistance, and time. Sometimes the delay says more about institutions than about ideas.Einstein received his Nobel Prize. Relativity received something else entirely: permanence. And that may be the more enduring award.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"
timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/amazon-plans-more-layoffs-what-ceo-andy-jassy-means-when-he-blames-culture-for-the-job-cuts/articleshow/127550456.cms,2026-01-26T13:42:00+00:00,"Every round of layoffs comes with a stated reason. Sometimes it is slowing revenue, sometimes it is automation, or sometimes it is “efficiency.”At Amazon, the explanation was different in October 2025.According to Reuters, Amazon is preparing a second round of corporate job cuts next week, as part of a broader plan to eliminate around 30,000 roles. The first round in October reduced about 14,000 white-collar positions. The upcoming cuts are expected to be of similar scale.The layoffs are likely to affect employees in Amazon Web Services (AWS), retail operations, Prime Video and the human resources division known internally as People Experience and Technology, Reuters said. On paper, 30,000 jobs represent less than 2% of Amazon’s total global workforce of about 1.58 million employees. But they account for nearly 10%of its corporate staff. If completed, this would be the largest layoff in the company’s three-decade history.The more revealing change, however, lies not in the numbers but in the explanation.From artificial intelligence to “culture”When Amazon announced the October cuts, the company linked them to the rise of AI. In an internal letter cited by various media sources, the company described AI as “the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” adding that it enables companies to innovate faster.But during Amazon’s third-quarter earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy reframed the reasoning. The reduction, he said, was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Rather, “it’s culture.”He elaborated: “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers.”That distinction is one of significance. If AI were the primary driver, the story would be about technology replacing human tasks. By attributing the cuts to culture, Jassy is pointing to structure rather than software.What “culture” means inside a corporationIn corporate language, culture often refers to decision-making norms, reporting lines and how authority flows. When Jassy speaks of “layers,” he is describing management tiers that can slow approvals and diffuse accountability.Over time, as companies expand, teams multiply. New roles are created to coordinate, supervise and review. Each additional layer may seem rational in isolation. Collectively, they can produce what executives call organisational bloat.Bureaucracy, in this context, does not simply mean paperwork. It means processes that require multiple approvals, overlapping responsibilities and slower execution.Jassy’s comments suggest that Amazon believes it has accumulated too many such layers. The layoffs are being framed as a structural correction rather than a response to weak demand.This framing also aligns with his earlier statement. In 2025, Jassy said he expected Amazon’s corporate workforce to shrink over time as efficiencies from AI increase, according to Reuters. Even if AI is not the stated cause of this round, it remains part of their efficiency strategy.A leaner centreThe cuts focus on corporate roles, not warehouse or fulfillment centre staff. The majority of Amazon’s workforce works in logistics and operations. The restructuring is therefore concentrated at the centre of decision making rather than at the edge of delivery.Affected employees in October were told they would remain on payroll for 90 days, during which they could apply for internal positions or seek external work, Reuters reports. That period expires on Monday.Inside the company, the effort to reduce layers has extended beyond headcount. Jassy has introduced an anonymous feedback system to identify inefficiencies. According to Reuters, more than 1,500 responses led to over 450 process changes. Amazon has also enforced a five-day return-to-office policy, one of the stricter mandates in the technology sector.Why this matters beyond AmazonLarge corporations often describe layoffs as strategic resets. The language chosen mirrors how leadership wants the restructuring to be understood.By saying the cuts are about culture rather than finances, Jassy is attempting to position Amazon as disciplined rather than distressed. The company is not presenting itself as reacting to crisis, it is presenting itself as correcting internal design.At the same time, culture is not an external force. It is shaped by leadership decisions over time. A company that has “too many layers” reached that point through years of hiring, expansion and delegation.When that structure is dismantled, the consequences are uneven. Some teams lose managers, some functions merge, some roles disappear entirely.The language of culture may sound abstract. For the individuals affected, it translates into job loss.The coming week will show whether this second round completes Amazon’s target of cutting around 30,000 corporate roles or signals further restructuring ahead.

For generations of Indians, it is not only a national song but also a familiar, stirring, and deeply personal one. This year, as India marks its 77th Republic Day, that childhood memory finds renewed meaning. The celebrations unfold under the central theme “150 Years of Vande Mataram,” placing the national song at the heart of the country’s ceremonial, cultural, and civic life.From the Republic Day Parade to tableaux, cultural performances, public competitions, and outreach programmes, Vande Mataram will echo across platforms, reminding citizens of a shared past while inviting reflection on India’s evolving identity.Born in poetry, shaped by historyVande Mataram started as a poem composed in the 1870s by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, written in Sanskritised Bengali and later published in his 1882 novel Anandamath. Chatterjee, a civil servant who was deeply engaged with India’s past. He penned the verses during a period when colonial autorities tried to promote “God Save the King” as the anthem of Indian subjects.Written in a spontaneous blend of Sanskrit and Bengali, the poem offered something radical for its time: A lyrical ode to the motherland.Without making any religious allusions, its opening verses praised India's abundance and beauty. Hindu goddess-related imagery was introduced in later stanzas, a change that would ultimately influence discussions regarding its public use.From literature to liberation cryWhat had begun as poetry soon turned into a protest. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vande Mataram was one of the most powerful catchphrases for the Indian independence movement. Rabindranath Tagore sang it at the Calcutta Congress in 1896. It appeared in some of India's first political films, had an impact on journals, and reverberated through subsequent Congress meetings.It influenced journals, reverberated through later Congress meetings, and even appeared in some of India's first political movies.In response, Anandamath and public performances of the song were outlawed by colonial authorities. For disobeying the directive, activists were imprisoned. However, the refrain continued to get louder, being shouted in defiance, whispered in meetings, and sung in marches.It was transported across regions by freedom fighters. Vande Mataram was written on Bhikaiji Cama's 1907 rendition of India's first flag. Its verses were published in revolutionary journals. The song's opening line was reportedly Matangini Hazra's last words before colonial police shot and killed her.Debates, compromise, and national acceptanceAs India moved closer to independence, the song’s religious imagery became a point of contention. The Indian National Congress decided in 1937 to use only the first two stanzas, which talked about the motherland without mentioning religion—as the national anthem after conferring with prominent figures like Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Maulana Azad, and Mahatma Gandhi.Despite the emergence of new slogans, Gandhi insisted that Vande Mataram not be disregarded and remained steadfast in his support. He believed the song carried a memory of sacrifice, so he warned against discarding it carelessly.Vande Mataram was officially acknowledged as the National Song in 1950 when independent India gave it the same status as the National Anthem.Why it still mattersAs India commemorates 150 years of Vande Mataram, the occasion invites more than nostalgia. It asks us to revisit a shared cultural inheritance, one shaped by poetry, resistance, debate, and compromise.For many of us, the song began as a memorised verse.

The closure affected educational institutions throughout the state.The Maharashtra government announced an immediate public holiday after Pawar’s chartered aircraft crashed while attempting to land at Baramati Airport on Wednesday morning. All schools were ordered to remain shut on Wednesday as a mark of respect to the deceased leader.However, the state school education directorate issued the circular declaring Wednesday a holiday only around 3 pm. By that time, most schools had already completed their morning sessions and were in the middle of afternoon classes. Rajesh Pandya of the Teachers Democratic Front criticised the abrupt announcement, saying, “Notifying the closure of schools suddenly shouldn’t be done because then how is the school supposed to arrange for the children to be sent back. A more effective thing would have been to declare a holiday tomorrow in light of the funeral.” There is no holiday for schools on Thursday and Friday, and educational institutions are expected to function as usual on both days.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced a three-day state mourning period, during which the national flag is flying at half-mast on all government buildings across Maharashtra. He also cancelled all his programmes and, along with fellow Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, travelled to Baramati immediately after the incident, describing Pawar’s death as an “unprecedented loss” for the state.The 66-year-old Pawar died along with four others when his Learjet 45 crashed around 8:45 am while travelling from Mumbai to Baramati. The victims included pilot Sumit Kapoor, co-pilot Shambhavi Pathak, flight attendant Pinky Mali, and Pawar’s personal security officer HC Vidhit Jadhav.According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the VSR Aviation-operated aircraft crashed during a second approach to runway 11 at Baramati Airport. The plane veered off the runway, burst into flames, and was destroyed on impact. The DGCA has launched a detailed investigation into the cause of the crash.Pawar, nephew of veteran politician Sharad Pawar, was one of Maharashtra’s most influential leaders. He served as the state’s longest-serving deputy chief minister and held key portfolios including water resources, finance, and energy. His death has sent shockwaves across the political spectrum, with leaders from across party lines expressing grief.President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have conveyed their condolences to Pawar’s family.Ready to navigate global policies?

E. Muthunayagam, one of the principal architects of India’s liquid propulsion programme, has been awarded the Padma Shri in 2026 in the field of Science and Engineering. Dr. Muthunayagam was a pioneer in the initial space programs of India, and his contribution to the development of liquid propulsion systems in the country has been instrumental in launching the country’s most important launch vehicles, such as the PSLV and GSLV. As the founder Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Dr. Muthunayagam’s illustrious career has been a long and storied one, spanning several decades.From Nagercoil to global classroomsA. E. Muthunayagam was born on January 11, 1939, in Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu. He showed early promise in engineering and applied sciences. He completed his Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Madras in 1960 with first-class honors. He further pursued his master’s degree from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru in 1962 with distinction. He further acquired a Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University, USA, in 1965, where he was exposed to the latest aerospace research, including projects associated with NASA. Later, he diversified his interests into law, acquiring an LLB degree from the University of Kerala in 1975.The architect of India’s rocket propulsionDr Muthunayagam joined the emerging space programme in India in 1966 and settled in Thiruvananthapuram. He was one of the first batches of scientists recruited by Vikram Sarabhai, who is often called the father of the Indian space program.Over the next decades, he held several key positions at the Space Science and Technology Centre (SSTC), later renamed Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), heading both the Propulsion Engineering and Mechanical Engineering divisions. He led critical projects including the Rohini 125 Rocket Project, the Rohini Multi-stage Rocket Project, and the Strip Wound Motor Project. He also served as Project Engineer and Chairman of the Board of Administration at the Static Test and Evaluation Complex in Sriharikota.Building liquid propulsion systemsDr Muthunayagam’s most enduring contribution came with the development of liquid propulsion technology. As Project Manager of the Vikas engine project, developed in collaboration with a French aerospace company, he oversaw a major technological leap that became the backbone of India’s launch vehicles.In November 1985, he became the founding Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), a role he held until April 1994. Under his leadership, LPSC established critical test stands and assembly facilities at Mahendragiri, enabling the testing of liquid stages for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). He also chaired the Rocket Propulsion Board and led mission readiness reviews for the ASLV D1 and D2 launches.Contributions beyond ISROAfter LPSC, Dr Muthunayagam continued to serve in national and academic capacities. He was Secretary of the Department of Ocean Development, Executive Vice-President of the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, and Chairman of the Board of Governors of IIT Madras (2005–2008). He also served on national advisory committees in science, technology, and propulsion.Internationally, he chaired the Regional Committee of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission for the Central Indian Ocean and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, while serving as Vice-Chairman of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission during 1996–1998.In academia, he coordinated the establishment of ancillary industrial units around space centres, reviewed papers for international journals, and examined postgraduate theses in mechanical engineering for Indian and foreign universities.Recognition and professional standingDr Muthunayagam is a Fellow of leading scientific and engineering bodies, including the Indian National Academy of Engineering, the Astronautical Society of India, the Aeronautical Society of India, and the Institution of Engineers (India). He is also a foreign member of the Academy of Cosmonautics, Moscow.The Padma Shri 2026 award recognizes Dr. Muthunayagam for his lifetime of service, especially for laying the technological base for the space program of India. Right from his days with Vikram Sarabhai to the development of liquid propulsion at LPSC, Dr. Muthunayagam has been at the forefront of India’s success in space.Ready to navigate global policies?

It signalled a broader moment for India’s human space ambitions, a recognition of years of preparation, rigorous training, and an unwavering commitment to pushing the country’s scientific frontiers.For colleagues, he is simply “Shux”. For India, he stands as its second astronaut and the first from the country to have stayed aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Shortly after the formal announcement of his national honour, Shukla reflected on what such recognition truly meant to him. Shubhanshu Shukla said to TNN, “I feel immensely proud and deeply grateful for the honour conferred upon me. When I embarked on this journey [as an astronaut], I did so as a representative of every Indian. Today, as I receive this recognition, I experience it as a collective blessing from the people of India. I am truly humbled by this award.”Yet, alongside pride came a sharpened sense of responsibility. He further added,“…My journey must translate into meaningful and tangible outcomes, particularly in advancing our future human space missions. I remain firmly committed to ensuring that the opportunity I was given-to journey into space from Bharat-opens the door for many more such opportunities in the years ahead.”He also acknowledged institutional support, adding: “…I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Government of India for bestowing this prestigious honour upon me.”The recognition places Shukla in a distinguished lineage. Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma, India’s first astronaut who travelled to space in April 1984, had also been decorated for his historic mission. From Lucknow classrooms to elite flight decksBorn in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, Shubhanshu Shukla’s fascination with aviation began early. That curiosity soon transformed into a disciplined academic and professional journey.He entered the National Defence Academy (NDA) in 2003, where he pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, combining military training with academic rigour. Commissioned into the Indian Air Force in 2006, Shukla went on to log over 2,000 flying hours across a formidable range of aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-21, MiG-29, Jaguar, Hawk, Dornier 228 and An-32. His reputation as both a combat leader and test pilot grew steadily.Recognising the need for deeper technical expertise, he later completed a Master of Technology in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. The programme strengthened his grounding in advanced engineering, knowledge that would later prove vital for astronaut training and space missions.In 2019, Shukla was selected for India’s ambitious Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme. This marked the beginning of intensive preparation, including advanced training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Moscow and at the Indian Astronaut Training Facility in Bengaluru, supplemented by international sessions in Germany and Japan.Life aboard the ISS and a global classroom in orbitShukla’s time aboard the ISS in mid-2025 coincided with a landmark moment, 25 years of continuous human presence on the orbital laboratory. In his first full-fledged exclusive interview after that milestone, he described the station as a living example of what sustained cooperation can achieve. That experience now feeds directly into his next chapter.Grounded in discipline, reaching for the starsAway from flight decks and laboratories, Shukla balances his demanding career with family life alongside his wife, Dr Kamna Shukla, a dentist. He retains a keen interest in physical fitness and scientific reading, which reflects the discipline he was inculcated with during his NDA days.Lucknow to IISc, from fighter cockpits to orbital labs, Shubhanshu Shukla’s journey is one of deliberate training and historical opportunity. The Padma Shri is more than a badge of honor for where he has been; it is also a nod towards the future that awaits him.As India forges ahead with its presence in human space exploration, Shukla remains both a symbol and a participant in this journey, a testament to the fact that education, training, and collaboration can raise the ambitions of a nation beyond the boundaries of the planet.Ready to navigate global policies?

Revenue targets are met, products are launched, valuations rise, and a chief executive becomes the visible face of that climb. Success appears singular, concentrated in one office, one name.Sundar Pichai’s words change that framing. “As a leader, it is important to not just see your own success, but focus on the success of others.” The perspective sounds simple, but its implications are not.Redefining what leadership measuresIn large organisations, leadership decisions travel far beyond quarterly reports. They shape hiring priorities, product roadmaps, workplace culture and the pace at which teams take risks. When a leader centres only personal performance or public perception, incentives narrow. Teams learn to optimise for approval upward, not growth outward.Pichai’s formulation shifts the axis. If the measure of leadership includes how many others advance, build, and lead in turn, then authority becomes distributive. The question changes from “Did I win?” to “Did the system I oversee enable others to win?”Innovation depends on shared successIn a company like Google, where thousands of engineers, researchers and managers work across products and regions, the difference matters. Innovation rarely comes from a single office. It depends on whether teams feel trusted to experiment, whether failures are absorbed without stigma, and whether credit flows across layers of hierarchy.A focus on others’ success also changes how leaders respond to uncertainty. Technology firms operate in cycles of rapid change, regulatory pressure and public scrutiny. In such environments, it is tempting to centralise control. Yet centralisation can slow response and mute internal expertise. Leaders who invest in the growth of others create capacity that outlasts their own tenure.The ethical dimension of shared growthThere is also an ethical dimension. When leadership is framed as personal triumph, organisations risk reinforcing competition that excludes those without early access to power. When it is framed as stewardship, the emphasis moves toward access, mentorship and institutional continuity. The leader’s legacy becomes less about a headline metric and more about the durability of teams.This idea is not limited to technology companies. In public institutions, universities and startups, the same tension exists. Leaders who guard authority may secure short term stability. Leaders who develop others build depth. Over time, depth proves more resilient than visibility.Pichai’s statement therefore functions as both management advice and critique. It questions a culture that celebrates singular vision while relying on collective labour. It suggests that leadership is less about standing ahead of others and more about ensuring others can move forward.Personal wins may define a career moment. Enabling the success of others defines whether that moment compounds. In that distinction lies the difference between command and leadership.Ready to navigate global policies?

timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-the-value-of-blue-collar-work-will-increase-is-the-ai-boom-redefining-career-success/articleshow/127559175.cms,2026-01-26T21:30:00+00:00,"At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, made a point. Artificial intelligence, he said, is more likely to raise the value of blue-collar work. The claim is pretty familiar in parts of the labour debate. What makes it worth revisiting is how directly it questions long-held assumptions about how people advance at work.How career success has traditionally been definedFor decades, career progress followed a clear arc. Many leaders began close to the work, often in hands-on roles. Advancement meant moving away from physical systems and into offices, meetings, and management layers. Status rose as distance from the shop floor increased. Being senior often meant being abstracted from how things actually ran.Why early AI debates missed this groupEarly discussions around AI reinforced that pattern. The focus stayed on office roles, knowledge work, and desk-based tasks. Jobs tied to factories, warehouses, power grids, and data centres drew less attention, even though those systems continued to underpin the digital economy.The rise of the ‘new blue collar’Huang’s perspective points in a different direction. It centres on what some describe as the new blue collar. These are roles that mix physical work with digital and AI tools. They include technicians who keep data centres operating, workers who run advanced manufacturing equipment, and teams responsible for energy and infrastructure systems that artificial intelligence depends on. These jobs sit at the junction of software and physical reality. They are difficult to automate fully and costly to replace when failure occurs.What this could mean for leadershipThis does not imply that future chief executives will come only from technical or trade backgrounds. It does suggest that practical understanding is regaining weight. Leaders who know how power is delivered, how equipment fails, how safety risks surface, and why systems break under stress are often better placed to judge whether expansion is feasible or fragile.What workers should pay attention toFor individuals thinking about their own careers, the point is not necessarily to change paths. It is to notice where value is accumulating. If Huang’s view proves accurate, career success in the age of AI may depend less on distance from the work and more on proximity to how the real world functions.Ready to navigate global policies?

But for students, the more urgent question sits elsewhere: Not whether the regulations are just, but how they work; not intent, but procedure. What changes on campus when discrimination becomes a compliance issue rather than a discretionary grievance?Read closely, the regulations are neither a blunt instrument nor a moral manifesto. They are an attempt—uneven, ambitious, legally consequential—to turn equity into institutional routine. For students navigating everyday campus life, understanding the design of that routine matters more than the headlines around it. Discrimination as defined by the regulationsThe opening move of the regulations is expansive. Discrimination is defined broadly to include unfair, biased or differential treatment—explicit or implicit—on grounds such as religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth and disability. Crucially, the definition extends beyond intent to effect: Conduct that impairs dignity or equality of treatment is enough. This is a deliberate lowering of the evidentiary threshold. Harm does not need to be loud to be legible.Where the framework tightens is around caste. Caste-based discrimination, as a specific legal category within the regulations, is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes on the basis of caste or tribe. This anchoring reflects the constitutional logic of historical disadvantage. It also explains why this clause has attracted scrutiny. For students, the distinction to hold onto is this: The right to complain is universal, the classification of harm is not.Who can complain?Under the UGC 2026 equity regulations, the entry gate is deliberately wide. An “aggrieved person” is essentially anyone on campus—or seeking to enter it—who alleges discrimination within the scope of the rules. That means a student does not need a particular caste category, political backing, or institutional standing to file a complaint. The institution is not meant to decide who deserves to be heard; it is required to accept the grievance and process it through the prescribed mechanism.Where the document draws a sharper line is not at the point of filing, but at the point of classification. The regulations define discrimination broadly—covering unfair or biased treatment on grounds such as religion, race, gender, place of birth, disability and caste, including conduct that undermines dignity or equality of treatment. So a complaint can be examined as discrimination even when it does not fall under a narrower sub-category.That narrower sub-category is caste-based discrimination. The regulations define it specifically as discrimination on the basis of caste or tribe against members of SC, ST and OBC communities. This is the clause that has generated legal and political heat, but for students the practical takeaway is simpler: anyone can complain, but not every caste-related complaint will be labelled “caste-based discrimination” under the regulations’ definition. If it does not fit that definition, it does not vanish; it is still processed under the broader umbrella of discrimination (or, where relevant, other protected grounds). The door stays open—the label changes, and the pathway inside the system follows that label.The institutional chain: Who does what, and in what orderThe power of the UGC 2026 equity framework lies not in slogans but in its institutional wiring. Three bodies matter most to students: the Equal Opportunity Centre, the Equity Committee, and the Ombudsperson. Each has a distinct role, and none is meant to operate alone.The Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC): The system’s nerve centreEvery higher education institution is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre. Where colleges lack capacity, affiliating universities must extend coverage. The EOC is the administrative hub: It receives complaints, coordinates inquiries, provides guidance, links complainants to legal aid where necessary, and compiles biannual public reports.The EOC is responsible for ensuring that complaints do not die in corridors or get lost in informal mediation. Its function is to keep the system moving. Under the EOC an Equity Committee is constituted. It is the primary inquiry body. It is chaired by the head of the institution and must include senior faculty, a staff representative, civil-society members, and mandatory representation from OBC, SC, ST, women and persons with disabilities. Student representatives can be included as special invitees.The committee structure is meant to diffuse power and embed diversity in judgment itself. The committee’s job is to examine complaints, hear responses, assess material, and submit a reasoned report. It does not act as prosecutor or executioner. Its authority lies in finding, not punishing.Equity Squads: Eyes, not handsEquity Squads are small teams mandated to monitor campus spaces—hostels, libraries, common areas—identified as vulnerable to exclusion or discriminatory practices. They observe, report and flag patterns to the EOC.What they do not have is disciplinary power. They cannot suspend, penalise, or adjudicate. Their role is preventive and informational. The fear that they constitute roaming enforcement units is not borne out by the text; whether that fear materialises will depend entirely on institutional behaviour.The Ombudsperson: An appeal gate outside campus powerThe Ombudsperson is the regulations’ outside check—the appeal authority kept at arm’s length from campus hierarchy and internal pressure. If the Equity Committee’s finding feels hurried, biased, or procedurally shaky, either side—complainant or respondent—can take it up with the Ombudsperson within 30 days. This matters because the Ombudsperson is not handpicked by the same campus that ran the inquiry; the appointment is made under UGC’s framework, precisely to limit institutional conflict. The role is meant for a person of eminence with serious experience in law, public administration, education or social justice. And the job is not to “re-try” the case like a second committee. It is to audit the fairness of the process, test the logic of the conclusion, and fix procedural errors before they harden into injustice.How the process actually movesThe regulations are specific about timelines. Once a complaint is received, the Equity Committee must convene within 24 hours. The inquiry report must be completed within 15 working days. The head of the institution then has seven working days to initiate action based on that report. Any aggrieved party—complainant or respondent—may appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days of receiving the committee’s findings or the institutional decision based on them. This keeps the sequence tight, accurate, and legally clean. Complainants may request confidentiality, and institutions are required to protect identity during inquiry. Confidentiality does not mean anonymity in outcome, nor does it eliminate the need for evidence or response. It is a control on disclosure, not a shortcut around the process.Punishment and consequencesThe regulations don’t create a new “campus court” with fresh offences. Instead, they do something more practical: they make non-compliance a punishable failure for the institution. If an enquiry finds that a university or college has not followed the rules, the UGC can hit it where it hurts—by barring it from UGC schemes, stopping it from running degree programmes, blocking ODL/online courses, and even removing it from the UGC’s recognised lists under Sections 2(f) and 12B.For individual cases, the regulations don’t spell out a new punishment chart. They say the head of the institution must take action as per the institution’s own rules (student discipline codes or service rules). If the facts point to a criminal offence, the rules require that police authorities be informed promptly—and even the helpline route allows information to be forwarded to police if, on the face of it, penal law is involved.What the regulations leave to institutions The loudest anxieties sit in the silences. The regulations do not codify standards of proof. They do not prescribe penalties for malicious complaints or spell out reputational safeguards in parallel with victim protection. This is not oversight so much as delegation. The UGC has chosen architecture over micromanagement. But delegation assumes institutional maturity, a quality students are not always convinced universities possess. That mistrust, more than ideology, fuels the present unease.The end of the “let it pass” approachWhat the regulations attempt is simple, and deliberately uncomfortable: they shift discrimination from being a “sensitive campus matter” to being a governance failure with a compliance price tag. The timelines compress delay, the appeal route prevents local burial, and confidentiality is treated as a discipline of disclosure, not a licence to skip proof. Most importantly, the enforcement logic is institutional: If a university refuses to build the prevention-and-redressal architecture, it risks consequences that go beyond reputational embarrassment and enter the domain of recognition, permissions, and programmes. The message is not that every complaint will end in punishment. The message is that doing nothing is no longer an option.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Spare bedrooms turned into meeting rooms. Rush-hour trains fell silent. Employers spoke the language of flexibility, and geography loosened its grip on opportunity. Remote work was no longer a perk; it was becoming policy. The country even earned a new reputation, emerging as Europe’s work-from-home capital.That experiment is now unravelling. Fresh data from jobs platform Adzuna shows that advertisements for remote roles in December fell 42 per cent compared with the same period last year, marking their lowest level since Covid reshaped the labour market. At the same time, listings for office-based jobs surged, signalling a decisive shift back towards physical workplaces. What is driving this reversal is not nostalgia for office culture. It is power, reshaped by a weakening jobs market.Scarcity changes everythingThe balance between employers and workers has tilted sharply in recent months. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there are now 2.3 jobseekers competing for every advertised vacancy. Unemployment has climbed to 5.1 per cent, the highest rate since 2020. For the first time since the euro was introduced, Britain’s joblessness now rivals that of the European Union.These are not abstract figures. They represent a structural change in leverage. When vacancies are plentiful, workers negotiate. When jobs become scarce, employers dictate terms. Remote work, once secured through confidence and choice, is increasingly being replaced by requirements to return to desks.In practical terms, this means employers are once again filling office-based roles that would have struggled to attract candidates just two years ago.From Europe’s remote-work capital to enforced proximityBritain’s retreat from flexible work is especially striking given its recent history. A report from King’s College London had previously identified the UK as Europe’s work-from-home leader, with employees spending more days away from the office than their continental counterparts. Hybrid schedules had become embedded in professional life, reshaping commuting patterns, family routines, and even regional housing markets.That momentum is fading. As competition for roles grows fiercer, jobseekers are finding fewer remote options and more mandates for in-person attendance. The implicit message is clear: flexibility is no longer guaranteed. Presence is back in fashion.This shift carries consequences beyond daily commutes. Remote work had begun to redistribute opportunity, allowing talent outside major cities to access high-paying roles and offering parents and caregivers greater balance. Its decline risks reinforcing old inequalities, quietly centralising opportunity once again.Policy pressure meets economic cautionThe changing jobs landscape is not being shaped by market forces alone. Businesses are also navigating a fresh regulatory environment. The Employment Rights Act, which became law in December, represents the largest expansion of worker protections in more than a decade. Measures such as statutory sick pay from day one and the abolition of zero-hours contracts are intended to strengthen job security.Yet they also introduce new costs and obligations for employers. The Government has estimated the overall impact of the legislation at around £1 billion. Industry groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce, have warned that this figure significantly understates the real burden, particularly for sectors such as retail and hospitality that rely heavily on flexible staffing.Against a backdrop of higher taxes and a fragile economy, many businesses are responding defensively, slowing recruitment, tightening criteria, and favouring traditional office-based roles that feel easier to supervise and manage.The narrowing gap between UK and EU unemployment levels has further sharpened concerns, fuelling debate over whether Britain’s labour market challenges are being compounded by domestic tax and employment policies.A recalibration of powerWhat is unfolding is not simply a return to offices. It is a deeper recalibration of authority in the workplace. The pandemic forced a radical rethink of how, where, and when work could be done. For a time, employees held unprecedented leverage, reshaping corporate norms around flexibility and autonomy. That chapter is closing.As vacancies fall and jobseekers multiply, employers are reclaiming control. The home office, once a symbol of progress and modernity, is becoming collateral damage in a broader economic slowdown.For workers, the implications are sobering: fewer choices, tougher competition, and shrinking negotiating power. For businesses, the short-term comfort of office-based oversight may come at the expense of long-term innovation and inclusivity.And for Britain, the retreat from remote work reveals an uncomfortable truth. Flexibility flourishes in prosperity. In uncertainty, it is often the first casualty.The great experiment in distributed work has not ended because it failed. It is being quietly sidelined by a tightening economy, one vacancy, one commute, and one withdrawn remote listing at a time.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Employability has become the actual value of education in a labour market that is rapidly evolving. The Wheebox India Skills Report 2026 is following this change in disciplines, which indicates how academic streams have turned into workplace preparedness. One of them is the Bachelor of Pharmacy (B.Pharma) which has a clear account of recovery and slow fortification.B.Pharma started to recover after falling to 45 in the year 2020 and to 37.24 in 2021. Since 2022, the trends in employability scores are constantly increasing indicating the increasing conformability between the pharmaceutical education and the industry requirements.B.Pharma employability: Six-year journey (2020–2025)YearEmployability score202045.00202137.24202244.63202357.51202454.00202556.00The data presents a form of a slight decrease in 2021, then a great recovery in 2022 and a sharp increase in 2023. Despite a slight decrease in 2024, in 2025, the trend of employability began to rise, which highlights a more general tendency of recovery.The reason why employability is increasingThis positive shift reflects the shifts in the pharmaceutical and healthcare environment in India. Expanding activities in generic medicines, vaccines, and active pharmaceutical ingredients have been accompanied by the growth of the country in terms of clinical research, regulatory services, and healthcare activities.Theoretical knowledge is no longer adequate to employers. Entry-level requirements are also getting skills in quality systems, documentation, compliance, and basic data handling. Many institutions have in response intensified practical training and industry exposure and in the process, they have assisted students to reduce the gap between classroom training and reality of the workplace. What has come out is a degree that is slowly finding its way back following the upheaval of the early 2020s.Career options in B.PharmaB.Pharma currently is accessible to various layers of the healthcare system:Pharmaceutical manufacturing and production: The functions in formulation, production planning, quality control, and quality assurance continue to be placed at the core of the industry.Clinical research: The graduates are allowed to be employed in trial management, clinical information management, and documentation of regulations to support the India-based and international-based research.Pharmacovigilance and drug safety: A rapidly evolving discipline that pays attention to the negative effects and the safety of medicines according to international standards.Regulatory issues: Professionals assist companies to pass through the approval procedures and compliance procedures in various nations.Medical writing and scientific communication: Opportunities Opportunities in those who are inclined towards research-based writing, documentation, and healthcare content.Sales, marketing, product management: Pharma companies are starting to take on B.Pharma graduates in areas of specialised therapy, in technical sales and in product strategy.Higher learning and research: Most of them do M.Pharma, healthcare management programmes or PhD work, which results in a career in academia, advanced research or leadership.A college degree rediscovers its importanceIn the 2020- 2025 trend, B.Pharma will be at its lowest point in 2021, but there will be an improvement to a better posture by 2025. This is not just an increase in numbers but is an indication of the responsiveness of pharmacy education to the demands of the real world.To students, B.Pharma is no longer a specialist path. Now it relates science to regulation, safety, research, and business—providing more opportunities in the competitive employment market. With the Indian healthcare industry still growing, the pharmacy graduates in the country who are well-trained are gaining ground.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

By evening, the goals are achieved, but tomorrow, it all starts again. For millions of young workers, this is life in entry-level roles across customer service, operations, and sales. The monotony, the endless pressure, the sense that progress never sticks—it’s a cycle that is slowly wearing them down. One Reddit post sums it up in four words: “This cannot be my life.” The post, written by a 22-year-old employee, has resonated with thousands who feel the same early-career exhaustion. Work that keeps restartingOne thing that stands out in the Reddit post is the sense of going in circles. Every quarter, new KRAs, check-ins, and targets pile up. When you finally meet them, the next day feels just like the last—no real change in your role, responsibilities, or pay. For many early-career employees in customer service, operations, or sales, this is normal. The work itself may not be overwhelming, but the constant cycle of effort with little visible progress can leave anyone feeling drained.Research reflects this pattern. According to Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace report, only about 21% of employees worldwide feel engaged in their work, meaning most workers are either disconnected or actively disengaged on the job. At the same time, stress levels remain high: around 40% of workers reported experiencing a lot of stress the previous day, and younger employees under 35 show slightly higher daily stress than older colleagues.When hard work stops feeling meaningfulThe post also questions a familiar idea: that putting in the effort now will eventually make things easier.For many young workers, that promise feels uncertain. Salaries often cover basic expenses but leave little room for savings. Promotions are slow. The pressure to constantly “perform” remains, regardless of experience.Deloitte’s Global Gen Z and Millennial Survey finds that work‑related stress is now one of the top concerns for younger employees. Around 40% of Gen Z respondents say they feel stressed or anxious most or all of the time, and a significant share cite job‑related factors—long hours, lack of recognition and work/life balance—as contributors to that stress. Many also say they struggle to see how their day‑to‑day tasks connect to long‑term career growth or stability.It is not that this generation dislikes work. Rather, they are uneasy with work that feels disconnected from outcomes.Rethinking the idea of moving upAnother telling moment in the post is the hesitation around career progression. The Reddit poster notes that moving up may simply replace individual targets with responsibility for a team’s performance.The worry is quite justified. Research at several workplaces have revealed that middle managers end up working more hours and gaining higher stress, all without a proportionate increase in control or job satisfaction. So, when young professionals see their superiors going through these problems, the conventional ladder doesn't seem very enticing to them.Location, effort, and unequal returnsThe post also touches on a quieter, but very real frustration: where you work. For many young professionals, putting in long hours in a developing economy while saving for months just to take a short vacation is exhausting. And then there’s the awareness that similar roles abroad pay far more for the same work. With remote jobs and global salary data becoming more accessible, it’s hard not to notice the gap—and even harder not to question whether the effort feels fairly rewarded.Burnout is a signal, not a failureMental health experts emphasize that burnout, especially early in a career, is not a personal failure. According to the World Health Organization, burnout is a workplace phenomenon caused by prolonged, unmanaged stress. Seen this way, the Reddit post is not a personal breakdown—it’s a warning sign. At 22, the writer isn’t asking for an easy path. They are questioning whether constant pressure, limited rewards, and repetitive work should be accepted as normal. For many young professionals reading it, the post doesn’t feel extreme—it feels familiar.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"

This is the core argument made by Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, who said companies will only see real returns from AI if learning starts at the top of the structure.Speaking to Bloomberg Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Sweet said leaders must first build their own understanding of AI before expecting their workforce to adapt. Without that, companies will struggle to change how they operate or what they offer, she believes.“If leaders don’t understand AI, they can’t lead the company through the changes,” Sweet said. “In three years, you should be able to say, ‘My company has different services and has different insights.’ That requires a depth of learning from leaders first, and then you have to bring everybody along the way. So leader-led learning is absolutely critical.”A three-year test for AI transformationSweet put AI adoption as a test that will play out over a short horizon. Within three years, she said, companies should be able to point to concrete differences in services and insights that are enabled by AI. If they cannot, that signals a failure of leadership rather than technology. Her perspective shows how Accenture has approached AI internally since late 2022, following the release of widely used generative AI tools. Instead of starting with mass employee training, the company focused first on its senior leadership. According to Sweet, most of the early training efforts were directed at Accenture’s top executives, with the aim of ensuring they understood the tools well enough to make informed decisions.Why executives need to ‘touch the keyboard’That approach, she said, is not theoretical. Asked by Bloomberg’s Francine Lacqua for a practical example that could apply to workforces or even citizens, Sweet described what one client had learned the hard way.“One of my clients told me that, until they had their 300 leaders touch keyboards and see what AI could do, they couldn’t get moving,” she said. “That’s a very tangible example.”Accenture followed a similar path, she added. After November 2022, the company prioritised hands on learning for its top 50 leaders. The goal was not to turn executives into engineers, but to ensure they understood what AI could and could not do, and how it might change business processes.“That’s what we mean by leader-led learning,” Sweet said. “And once you have that, it unlocks the possibilities of what it really means that it’s going to change everything.”Regulators face the same learning gapSweet also extended the argument beyond companies. In regulated industries, she said, the pace of AI adoption will depend in part on whether regulators themselves understand the technology. A lack of understanding, she warned, could translate into restrictions that slow or block deployment.“It’s also critical for regulators and regulated industries,” she said. “If regulators block AI, they won’t be able to scale or succeed.”As a result, Sweet argued that governments and non-profits face the same challenge as companies. Leaders in these sectors must invest in learning first, and then design strategies to train their organisations more broadly.Why sequencing mattersMany organisations are rolling out AI tools to employees while senior decision-makers remain removed from AI's day-to-day use. Sweet says that this gap creates a risk of superficial adoption, where AI is added on rather than integrated into how work is done.For Sweet, leaders must use the tools themselves, understand their limits and implications, and only then guide others through the transition. Without that foundation, she said, AI strategies are likely to stall.So leaders must sit down, use the technology themselves, and learn before asking others to follow.Ready to navigate global policies?

The system of honours in India recognizes achievement, bravery, and commitment, thus reflecting the fundamental values of the nation through awards in areas ranging from arts and sciences to defence and public service.Nowadays, it is a must for candidates who are getting ready for various competitive exams, such as banking, civil services, etc., to know these awards and the great personalities who have been awarded them. Understanding awards: A recognition of meritAn award is more than a ceremonial honour, it is a testament to achievement, excellence, and service. Whether in literature, science, social work, or military bravery, awards acknowledge those who have gone above and beyond in their fields, setting benchmarks for others to aspire to.India’s prestigious awards: Categories and significanceIndia’s honours are broadly classified into civilian, military, literature, arts, and sports awards. Some of the most notable include:Bharat Ratna (1954) – CivilianPadma Vibhushan (1954) – CivilianPadma Bhushan (1954) – CivilianPadma Shri (1954) – CivilianParam Vir Chakra (1950) – MilitaryAshoka Chakra (1952) – MilitaryShaurya Chakra (1952) – MilitaryVir Chakra (1947) – MilitaryDadasaheb Phalke Award (1969) – FilmArjuna Award (1961) – SportsRajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (1991) – SportsSahitya Akademi Award (1954) – LiteratureJnanpith Award (1961) – LiteratureThese honours are more than symbols; they are milestones of excellence, reflecting India’s commitment to celebrating talent and service across generations.Civilian Honours: Recognising exceptional serviceBharat Ratna: India’s top civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, is given to exceptional individuals who have made outstanding contributions in the fields of arts, science, public service, and social work. Among the great names who have been honoured with this award are C. V. Raman for his pioneering scientific work, Mother Teresa after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Amartya Sen following the Nobel Award in Economics, Bhimsen Joshi for his musical talent, and the industrialist JRD Tata.Padma Vibhushan: The country’s second-highest civilian award, which was established in 1954, is given for exceptional and distinguished service in any field, thus going beyond the limits of social, religious, and professional distinctions. The awardees include scientists, doctors, and eminent personalities of various disciplines who have been recognized as the architects of India's progress.Padma Bhushan: The Padma Bhushan, which is given for distinguished service of a high order, is a recognition of those individuals whose extraordinary accomplishments have significantly influenced the nation.Padma Shri: The fourth-highest civilian award in India, the Padma Shri, is given to the recipients on the occasion of Republic Day every year to those who have done remarkable work in the fields of literature, art, education, medicine, industry, social work, or sports.Military and Gallantry awards: Honouring braveryParam Vir Chakra: Established in 1950, this is India’s most prestigious wartime gallantry award. Often compared with the US Medal of Honour and the UK Victoria Cross, it recognises acts of supreme courage, valour, and self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy.Ashoka Chakra: Instituted in 1952, this is the highest peacetime military honour, awarded for extraordinary bravery and selflessness beyond the battlefield.Mahavir Chakra: As a recognition of outstanding courage and unflinching devotion to duty, Mahavir Chakra is the second-highest wartime gallantry award.

In another, it is quietly viewed as poor planning. A message sent after work hours can signal dedication to some, and disrespect to others. Across workplaces today, the same actions are being interpreted in sharply different ways—not because people disagree on work ethic, but because they were shaped by very different realities.From generations that learned to survive through silence, to those that built identities around work, to younger employees who see boundaries as non-negotiable, the modern workplace has become a meeting point of conflicting values. What one group calls professionalism, another calls pressure. What once signalled loyalty now raises questions about balance, burnout, and fairness.These differences rarely surface in formal policies. Instead, they appear in everyday moments—missed calls, late-night messages, unspoken expectations, and decisions to stay or leave. One such example, shared recently on LinkedIn by communications professional Shilpi Shukla, has helped crystallise the conversation. Framed as a familiar workplace scenario rather than a specific case, it captured a deeper generational shift underway at work. A resignation that divided the workplaceIn her post, Shukla described a young employee who quits after repeatedly receiving work messages late at night. The situation was presented not as a reported incident, but as a reflection of experiences many professionals recognise.What made the example resonate was the range of reactions it provoked. Within the same workplace context, the decision could be read as disrespect, self-respect, immaturity, or courage—all at once.Reflecting on this divide, Shukla wrote, “One generation calls it attitude. Another calls it unprofessional. A third wishes they had done that sooner.” Her observation pointed to a reality many Indian workplaces are now confronting: employees are not just bringing different skills to work, but different histories of what work has demanded from them.To understand why such reactions clash so sharply, it helps to look beyond office policies and into the lived experiences of the generations sharing today’s workspaces.How history shaped workplace behaviourCareer expectations, in India and elsewhere, have always been closely tied to the social and economic environment of the time. For earlier generations, a job was not about personal fulfilment but about survival, social mobility, and securing one’s family’s future. Questioning authority or drawing boundaries was rarely an option.Shukla points out that the Silent Generation, raised during periods of war and scarcity, learned early that “stability mattered more than happiness.” Resilience became a necessity rather than a choice. Work was something to be protected, even if it meant staying quiet or enduring discomfort.The Baby Boomer generation, which followed, entered a comparatively stable economic phase. Jobs were loyal, institutions were strong, and long-term careers were possible. As Shukla noted, “hard work paid off,” reinforcing the belief that commitment and loyalty would be rewarded over time.That experience continues to shape how many senior professionals define dedication today—often through physical presence, constant availability, and a willingness to go the extra mile, regardless of personal cost.When commitment meant staying quietFor much of the 20th century, workplace culture was built on hierarchy and obedience. Speaking up carried risks, and silence was often interpreted as professionalism. Compliance, in many cases, was mistaken for competence.As Shukla observed, earlier generations prioritised endurance over personal well-being. “Stability mattered more than happiness,” she wrote, summing up an unspoken rule that governed many careers.In Indian offices in particular, long hours gradually became normalised as proof of sincerity. Discomfort was internalised, not discussed. Mental health was rarely acknowledged as part of professional life.These norms did not disappear with time. Instead, they were quietly passed down—continuing to shape expectations placed on younger employees, often without being openly articulated.A workplace now shared by very different realitiesAs newer generations entered the workforce, the economic and professional landscape shifted. Liberalisation, globalisation, contract work, and repeated cycles of restructuring made careers far less predictable. The assumption that effort alone would guarantee stability began to erode.This is where generational friction becomes most visible. Behaviours that older employees interpret as dedication are increasingly experienced by younger workers as intrusion. Where managers expect unquestioned availability, employees now look for clarity, boundaries, and consent.Shukla’s reflection on this shift is pointed: younger generations, having watched burnout and layoffs up close, are “choosing boundaries over blind loyalty” and refusing to “give their whole life to systems that do not protect them.”In this context, the late-night message is no longer just a communication lapse. It becomes a symbol of how unspoken expectations collide inside workplaces that now span four—and in some cases, five—generations.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

It is about survival—highlighted notes, half-remembered formulas, and the quiet hope that memory will last just long enough. Generations of students have relied on this ritual. Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize–winning physicist, thought it was the wrong place to begin. His advice was disarmingly simple: “Understand. Don’t memorise. Learn principles, not formulas.”What sounds like common sense now has strong evidence behind it. Research in education and cognitive science shows that students who invest time in understanding ideas, rather than memorising information, remember more, solve problems better, and cope more calmly when questions take an unfamiliar turn.A 2019 study published in Science—one of the world’s most respected peer-reviewed research journals—put numbers to that insight. Students who explained concepts in their own words scored between 20 and 30 per cent higher than those who relied mainly on memorisation. In that sense, Feynman wasn’t offering motivation. He was describing how learning actually works.Cramming works short-term, understanding lastsRote learning has always had one clear advantage: it feels efficient. You memorise today, reproduce tomorrow, and move on. The problem, research suggests, is that very little stays behind. Studies published in the Journal of Educational Psychology show that students who actively engage with what they are learning—by questioning it, explaining it, or teaching it—retain information far longer than those who simply memorise it.For students, the difference is tangible. Understanding reduces the need for frantic late-night revision and cuts down the anxiety that builds when exams approach. Feynman’s own approach, now widely known as the Feynman Technique, was built on this idea. If you can explain a topic in plain language, without hiding behind jargon, you probably understand it. And that understanding shows up when it matters.When you know the “why,” unfamiliar questions lose their powerOne of the biggest sources of exam fear is the unfamiliar question—the one that doesn’t look like anything in the textbook. Students who rely on memorised steps often freeze at this point. Those who understand underlying principles usually don’t. They may not see the answer immediately, but they know how to start.A 2020 study in Cognitive Science found that students trained to focus on principles solved new problems about 40 per cent more accurately than those who depended on memorised procedures. This matters most in entrance and competitive exams, where repetition is rare and thinking on your feet is the point. Understanding gives students room to adapt, and the confidence to stay calm when the question shifts.Better scores, less stress, skills that travel beyond examsMany students assume that understanding takes more time than memorisation. Research suggests the opposite. A study from the University of California, San Diego, found that students who learned conceptually revised more efficiently and performed better under exam pressure. More importantly, they reported feeling less overwhelmed by the process.The benefits extend well beyond marks. Learning this way builds habits that matter later—analytical thinking, flexibility, and the ability to deal with uncertainty. In college, at work, and in life, problems rarely arrive neatly packaged. Knowing how to think through them matters far more than recalling a formula.The payoff of learning the right wayFeynman’s advice endures because it speaks to something students experience firsthand. Memorisation may get you through an exam, but understanding carries you further. It brings steadier confidence, calmer preparation, and knowledge that doesn’t vanish once the paper is handed in.Decades after Feynman said it, research continues to echo the same message: learning principles makes knowledge last and work harder. When students are taught to think, not just to remember, education finally begins to deliver on its promise.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"

timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/chattel-slavery-2026-edition-how-fresher-job-offers-are-turning-careers-into-cages/articleshow/127630266.cms,2026-01-27T14:07:00+00:00,"It started with a Reddit post that read less like a job description and more like a warning label. Shared under the blunt caption “Chattel Slavery,” the post laid out the hiring terms of an IT company recruiting freshers straight from college. There was no outrage in the wording and no exaggeration in the claims. Just cold, numbered conditions presented plainly, leaving readers to absorb the implications on their own.Within hours, the post turned into a mirror for a generation of young professionals staring at offer letters and wondering when employment began to feel like captivity. The reactions were sharp, sarcastic, angry—and deeply familiar to anyone who’s navigated India’s IT hiring market in the last couple of years. A Fresher Offer That Comes With HandcuffsAccording to the Reddit post, the company’s hiring model looks like this:Six months of training.• A stipend between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000 a month.• Post-training salary ranging from Rs 3.4 to Rs 4.4 LPA.So far, nothing unusual. Then comes the clause that changes everything.A bond lasting nearly four years.Break it early, and the penalty kicks in:• Rs 5 lakh if you leave in the first or second year• Rs 4 lakh in the third• Rs 3 lakh in the fourthAs the post bluntly questioned: “How can the bond be more than the salary, and how is this even surviving in the first place?”That one line captured what thousands of freshers were thinking but rarely saying out loud.When a Toxic Job Becomes InescapableThe Reddit post didn’t just talk about policies—it described the reality of working under them.The workplace, it said, was openly toxic. People didn’t stay because they wanted to. They stayed because the bond made leaving financially terrifying.“No one wants to work here… it’s just because of the bond that they are working.”In an industry where switching jobs is often the fastest way to grow, this single clause freezes careers in place. You don’t upskill strategically. You don’t negotiate. You endure.And the longer you stay, the deeper you’re locked in.Legal on Paper, Intimidating in PracticeThe comment section quickly turned into an informal legal classroom.Several responses pointed out that while employment bonds aren’t automatically illegal, they must be reasonable—usually linked to actual training costs.As one reaction explained: “You can’t enforce arbitrary amounts when the company hasn’t really spent anything on training.”Another comment echoed the same idea more bluntly: “The amount looks punitive, not proportional.”In theory, this should protect employees. In reality, most freshers don’t have the money, time, or emotional bandwidth to challenge a company legally. The law may be on your side—but fear does most of the enforcing.The Experience Letter: Corporate Leverage 101One of the most disturbing details in the post was how documentation is used as leverage.Employees who attempt to leave before the bond period reportedly face a simple condition: pay the bond amount or forget about your experience letter.“They’re strong-armed into paying just to get documentation.”Add PF records into the mix, and walking away clean becomes nearly impossible. You’re not just quitting a job—you’re risking your professional history.The choice narrows fast: pay up, stay stuck, or disappear.The Business Model No One Admits Out LoudAmong the many reactions, one theory stood out for its uncomfortable logic. “Pay freshers low. Make the environment toxic. Let them quit. Collect bond money. Hire new freshers. Repeat.”If that sounds like an infinite money loop, that’s because it might be.In a slowed hiring market, desperation becomes fuel. Freshers become replaceable. Bonds become profit insurance.And the cycle continues quietly, one campus at a time.What This Reddit Post Is Really Telling Young WorkersThis wasn’t just another angry thread. It was a career reality check.It reminded young professionals that:A job offer isn’t always an opportunity“Training bonds” can quietly turn into career trapsToxic workplaces don’t need force—just paperworkMost of all, it showed why reading the fine print matters more than celebrating the offer.Because when a job makes you feel like freedom has a price tag attached, it’s not building a career.It’s building a cage.Ready to navigate global policies?

timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/careers/news/is-9-to-5-meeting-its-end-how-microshifting-is-rewriting-the-rules-of-the-workday/articleshow/127547442.cms,2026-01-26T11:35:00+00:00,"The modern workday is no longer a neat block of time neatly fenced between morning coffee and evening commute. It is porous, fragmented, and increasingly negotiated in private moments between meetings, school pickups, and side hustles. Somewhere between the pandemic’s forced experiment in remote work and today’s uneasy return to offices, a new rhythm has emerged, subtle, almost imperceptible if you are not looking for it. Its name is microshifting. Microshifting is not a corporate policy or a Silicon Valley manifesto. It is a worker-led recalibration of time itself. It means breaking the traditional workday into short, non-linear blocks organised around energy levels, domestic responsibilities, and bursts of productivity. Think of it as microdosing, but for labour. And it is spreading.According to Owl Labs’ 2025 State of Hybrid Work report, 65% of United Kingdom workers say they are interested in microshifting as an alternative to the rigid nine-to-five. Parents and caregivers are leading the charge, roughly three times more likely than non-caregivers to already be using, or actively considering, the practice. In quiet defiance of fixed schedules, employees are redesigning their days hour by hour.The anatomy of a microshiftIn practice, microshifting looks deceptively simple. An hour of focused work at dawn. A late-morning tennis match. A long Tuesday afternoon spent socialising, followed by concentrated work late into the night. A school drop-off folded between client calls. A medical appointment during traditional office hours, compensated with an evening sprint to clear deliverables.To sceptics, it may sound like chaos. To its practitioners, it is intentional design. This is not flexible working in the conventional sense. It is its more radical cousin, an extreme form of hybrid life where work is no longer a continuous stretch but a series of purposeful returns. Tasks are completed in focused bursts. Responsibilities are met without allegiance to a single block of time. Outcomes matter more than optics.Nearly 30% of hybrid workers now juggle a second job or side hustle, Owl Labs found. For them, microshifting is less lifestyle choice than logistical necessity. Childcare, eldercare, medical appointments, exercise, groceries, creative projects, modern life has become a mosaic, and work is learning to fit into its gaps.In many ways, microshifting simply formalises what freelancers, creators, and self-employed professionals have long practised: structuring days around output rather than clocked hours, stepping away and returning as energy allows.Born in crisis, sustained by choiceThe behaviour may be newly christened, but it was forged during the pandemic. When offices shut, and dining tables became desks, millions of workers tasted autonomy for the first time. They learned to work around children, partners, and shared spaces. They discovered that productivity did not require continuous supervision, only clarity of goals.Now, as companies attempt to restore structure, sometimes insisting on four days a week in the office, up from 23% in 2023 to 34% today, employees are quietly resisting. Not through protest, but through practice.The data reveals just how far this shift has already gone. More than half of employees, 51%, now schedule personal appointments during traditional working hours. Among Gen Z, that figure climbs to 61%. Millennials, too, are embracing the model, driven less by ideology than by the practical demands of adulthood.Perhaps most tellingly, workers say they would willingly sacrifice 9% of their annual salary in exchange for more flexible hours. Few statistics speak more clearly about priorities. Microshifting, in this sense, is not a perk. It is a renegotiation of value.Reimagined productivityCritics argue that such fragmented days risk diluting focus and discipline. Yet proponents counter that microshifting may actually enhance productivity. Freed from long commutes and performative office presence, workers can concentrate when they are at their best and disengage when they are not.The traditional workday was built for factories and filing cabinets. Today’s economy runs on cognition, creativity, and collaboration, qualities that do not obey a nine-to-five metronome.If anything, microshifting acknowledges a basic human truth: energy ebbs and flows. Creativity spikes at odd hours. Attention comes in waves. By aligning work with these natural rhythms, employees are not abandoning discipline; they are redefining it.What remains unresolved is how organisations will measure success in this new landscape. Output is easier to quantify in some roles than others. Trust becomes a central currency. Management shifts from monitoring presence to evaluating performance. The question is no longer whether work can be done this way. It already is.A quiet revolution in working lifeMicroshifting is not loud. There are no slogans, no glossy campaigns. It unfolds in calendar blocks quietly rearranged, in emails sent at unconventional hours, in workers who log on early, log off midday, and return after dinner.It is being driven not by HR departments but by employees themselves, by parents navigating childcare, caregivers managing appointments, Gen Z workers insisting on autonomy, and professionals stitching together multiple income streams. This is not disorganisation. It is adaptation.The boundaries of the workday are being redrawn in real time, one hour at a time. Employers would do well to notice. Because beneath the surface of hybrid policies and office mandates, a deeper transformation is underway.The future of work is not arriving with a bang. It is slipping in through the cracks of the old schedule, quietly, persistently, and on workers’ own terms.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"

timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/who-is-divya-dwivedi-why-she-is-at-the-centre-of-iit-delhis-caste-conference-controversy/articleshow/127715763.cms,2026-01-28T15:28:00+00:00,"For three days, IIT Delhi hosted an academic conference on caste and race. It was meant to remain what most such events are: A closed-loop argument among scholars. Instead, it became a public test of institutional judgment. A screenshot from the programme—centred on a contentious comparison—circulated online, drew sharp criticism, and pushed the institute into its most familiar posture in a reputational storm: Process. Explanations were sought. A fact-finding committee was constituted. In the middle of this sits Divya Dwivedi, the IIT Delhi professor who helped organise the conference—and a scholar whose ideas, more than once, have travelled from seminar rooms into political headlines, often without their footnotes.The Dalit–Palestinian comparison that put IIT Delhi on the spotThe flashpoint at IIT Delhi’s conference named Critical Philosophy of Caste & Race (CPCR3): Celebrating 25 Years of Durban: Indian Contributions to Combatting Caste and Racism, held from January 16–18, was not a speech, a slogan or a walkout. It was a paper title. A screenshot of the programme began circulating online showing a session item phrased as: What’s common between Dalits and Palestinians?That one line did what screenshots do in India: It collapsed context into intention. Critics read the comparison less as an academic provocation and more as political alignment — a domestic question of caste threaded into a live international conflict, with the IIT’s institutional weight seen as the amplifier because the session sat on its campus.One X (formerly Twitter) post accused IIT Delhi’s humanities department of “going full woke”, claiming it “invites radical activists” to push a “single-sided view on caste, ”flagging “sessions on comparisons of Dalits and Palestinians”.Then the language left the realm of campus criticism and entered something darker and more prosecutorial. In a letter to IIT Delhi director Rangan Banerjee on X, former interim CBI director M. Nageswara Rao did not argue the conference on academic grounds at all. He called the CPCR group an “anti-Hindu deep state initiative”, described its work as “anti-national and destabilising”, and said that holding the event in the Senate Hall made the director a “tacit patron”.His demand was unambiguous: The group should be disbanded.IIT Delhi responded in the language institutions reach for when argument turns reputational. In a statement on X, the institute said it had set up a fact-finding committee and sought explanations from the faculty organisers, adding that “appropriate actions will be initiated in accordance with institutional protocols, based on the committee’s findings.”It was a carefully neutral formulation—no defence of the conference, no endorsement of the criticism—signalling that the matter had moved out of the realm of debate and into formal scrutiny.Divya Dwivedi: The IIT Delhi professor behind the controversyInside IIT Delhi, Divya Dwivedi’s subject is the one that rarely stays inside the room. She teaches philosophy and literature in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences. But her work is not the kind that remains safely “literary”. It keeps returning to the questions that make institutions nervous when they leave the page: Power, identity, caste, and the language through which politics turns itself into common sense.She is a professor in IIT Delhi’s Department of Humanities and Social Sciences who teaches philosophy and literature. Her career at the institute has been linear and long: Assistant professor (2012–2020), associate professor (2020–2024), professor (2025 onwards). It is the kind of trajectory that usually stays inside departmental minutes, not news copy.Her work, however, sits in a zone that regularly crosses into public argument. Two of her better-known books are co-authored with Shaj Mohan: Gandhi and Philosophy: On Theological Anti-Politics (2019) and Indian Philosophy, Indian Revolution: On Caste and Politics (2024). The titles point to the intellectual lane she occupies—political philosophy, caste, and the ways power is theorised rather than merely described.If her books sit on the border of philosophy and politics, her research lives in the machinery that makes that border possible. She works on how ideas acquire authority: how a narrative becomes common sense, how fiction and truth trade places in public life, and how language turns hierarchy into something that looks “natural”. Her tools are drawn from narratology and deconstruction—not as academic ornament, but as method. And the questions she returns to are the ones that do not stay academic for long: caste, community, belonging. Thinkers such as Gandhi and Jean-Luc Nancy appear in that frame not as icons, but as instruments for asking what a society owes its people—and who gets to decide.A history that catches up with the presentRecord shows that this is not the first time Divya Dwivedi’s arguments have crossed from academic registers into wider political dispute. What has changed over time is not the substance of her concerns, but the platforms through which they have travelled—and the audiences they have reached.In 2019, during an NDTV television debate on Gandhi and politics, Dwivedi made remarks that drew sharp criticism. Speaking about caste, religion and political identity, she said, “Hindu right is the corollary of the idea that India is a Hindu majority population and this is a false majority. The Hindu religion was invented in the early 20th century in order to hide the fact that the lower caste people are the real majority of India…” She went further, linking this argument directly to Gandhi’s political role. “In fact, religious minorities have been a victim of this false majority and Gandhi has played a very significant role in its construction. He has helped construct a false Hindu majority and a new Hindu identity… He was one of the many upper caste leaders who constructed this origin for this polity but today we must discard it,” she added. At the time, the controversy was framed around tone and intent. Critics saw provocation and supporters pointed to her disciplinary background in political philosophy. The remarks were clipped, circulated, and debated largely outside their original argumentative frame.A year later, the same set of claims appeared again—this time in long form. The Caravan published an essay by Divya Dwivedi, Shaj Mohan and J. Reghu with a title that left little room for moderation: The Hindu Hoax: How upper castes invented a Hindu majority. The essay advanced a structural argument that “majority” in India is not merely demographic but historically and politically produced through caste power. Even before one enters the body of the text, the framing explains why the piece travelled so far: it challenged not individual prejudice, but the moral architecture of political identity itself.By 2023, the same intellectual position resurfaced—this time through an international media lens. In an interview with France 24, Dwivedi responded to a question about India’s economic growth, in which the journalist cited anecdotal examples of technological uplift. She dismissed such examples as “media-tised” and reframed the discussion in structural terms. “India has been shaped over 300 years by the racialised order of caste where 10% of the upper caste minority occupy 90% of powerful positions. That continues even today,” she said.Dwivedi further added, “In India, on the one hand, we have heritable power, prestige and wealth and, on the other, birth-based discrimination, poverty and exclusion determined by caste. It was my philosophical compulsion and intellectual duty to bring attention to this.”Read together, the pattern is less episodic than cumulative. Across television debate, long-form essay and international interview, Dwivedi has returned to the same core claim: That caste is not a residual social problem but an organising principle of power, and that political majorities are constructed rather than given. What changes is not the argument, but the medium.That history now shadows the present moment at IIT Delhi. The current row does not arrive as an isolated provocation. It lands on an already familiar template: A scholarly claim moves into the public arena, is interpreted less as analysis and more as stance, and then returns to campus as an institutional problem.The broader point here is not about one professor or one conference. It is about how Indian campuses now operate under two audiences at once: The academic audience that reads argument as argument, and the public audience that reads argument as intent. When the second audience becomes louder, institutions tend to respond in the only idiom that protects them on record: Process.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future.

Degrees, job titles and salaries dominate how success is measured and pursued. But former first lady Michelle Obama is arguing that something far less formal often carries equal weight and is routinely undervalued.Speaking recently on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Obama told listeners that cultivating friendships deserves the same seriousness as professional milestones. “The value of cultivating friendships is important,” she said. “It’s as important as the degree that you got in college; it’s as important as the job title and the salary.”Why friendships offer a form of controlIn a working world where individuals have limited control over hiring decisions or how they are perceived, Obama suggested that friendships function as a form of agency. They are spaces where confidence is built, ideas are tested and resilience is developed, often well before any external recognition arrives. “You can’t control who’s going to love you, who’s going to like you, who’s going to give you a job,” she said. “So work on being as whole as you can be.”This idea is not unique to Obama. Senior leaders have credited long-standing personal relationships, not formal networking, for shaping important career decisions.How long-term friendships shape elite careersFew examples are cited as often as Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King, whose friendship spans more than five decades. The two met early in their careers in Baltimore, when Winfrey was a young news anchor and King a production assistant. In interviews, both have said their professional paths would have looked very different without the other’s support. “Gayle was the only person who said, ‘I think you could do it,’” Winfrey said in a 2024 conversation cited by Fortune.Philanthropist Melinda French Gates has described a similar reliance on close friendships. She told Winfrey and King that she regularly turns to a small circle of women she has known for over 30 years when facing major decisions, calling them her “truth council”.Being selective is part of the lessonObama’s own experience adds a note of caution. As her public profile expanded, especially during her years in the White House, maintaining close friendships became harder. That shift, she said, reinforced the need for selectivity. “You’ve got to be really smart and selective about who you let in, who you let stay in, who you let out,” she told the podcast audience. “Who is ready to follow the path that you want to go on.”Why friendship can outperform networkingThe argument also challenges traditional career wisdom around networking. Suzy Welch, a professor of management practice at New York University, has said that friendships tend to outperform transactional networking over time. In a TikTok video last year, she dismissed the idea that constant networking leads to success. What works instead, she said, is building relationships over years, without immediate expectations. When opportunities arise later, those friendships often matter more than any exchange of business cards.A form of career capitalTaken together, these accounts point to a form of career capital. Not the kind listed on a resume, but the kind that accumulates slowly through trust, honesty and shared history. It is not easily measured, but for many at the top, it has proved difficult to replace.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"

The programme has been introduced under President Donald Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts Act and is being positioned by the administration as a major federal step to expand school choice across the country.According to the official announcement, the Education Freedom Tax Credit is designed to help families access a wider range of K-12 education options by lowering the cost of schooling, tutoring, and other education-related services. The administration says the initiative will give parents greater flexibility to choose learning options that best suit their children’s needs.What is the Education Freedom Tax Credit?The Education Freedom Tax Credit allows taxpayers to claim a federal income tax credit of up to $1,700 for donations made to approved Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs). The credit is applied against federal income taxes that would otherwise be paid to the government.These SGOs then use the donated funds to provide scholarships to students. The scholarships are intended to help children attend a school of choice or access other approved education services. The administration has described the programme as the largest national expansion of education freedom in US history.Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the tax credit would help families afford key education services such as tutoring and scholarships. She added that the programme recognises that students learn in different ways and aims to provide families with more options, regardless of income level.What expenses are covered?Scholarships funded through the Education Freedom Tax Credit can be used for a wide range of qualified K-12 education expenses. These include tuition fees for private schools, tutoring services at public schools, and education-related support for students with disabilities.The programme covers expenses connected to public, private, and charter schools. According to the Education Department, this broad coverage is intended to allow families to customise their child’s education based on individual learning needs rather than being limited to a single schooling model.States participating in the programmeAs of the announcement, 23 US states have opted into the Education Freedom Tax Credit. These states include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.The Treasury Department has encouraged other states to opt into the programme. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the policy places decision-making power in the hands of parents rather than federal agencies. He also said the tax credit is intended to increase access to education programmes for millions of families across the country.What happens next?The administration has said it will continue to work with states and governors to expand participation in the programme. Families in participating states may begin accessing scholarships through eligible Scholarship Granting Organizations, subject to state-level implementation.The full details of the Education Freedom Tax Credit, including eligibility rules and operational guidelines, are available in the joint fact sheet released by the US Departments of Education and Treasury.Ready to navigate global policies?

Jobs across Britain are being substituted by algorithms, task by task, and role by role. What might seem to be a technological upgrade on the surface is a problem with deep roots. In the UK, fewer job postings appear, and the entry-level jobs seem to vanish.New research from investment bank Morgan Stanley suggests the shift is already well underway. Over the past 12 months, the UK recorded a net job loss of 8 percent directly linked to AI adoption, twice the international average. Among the five major economies included in the study, only the United States posted net job gains tied to artificial intelligence.British companies surveyed said AI had lifted productivity and output, even as staff numbers declined. The message from boardrooms is efficiency. The message from the labour market is contraction.One of the authors of the Morgan Stanley report described the findings as an “early warning sign” of AI’s impact on employment. For Britain, that warning is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. A weakening job market meets rapid automationThe timing could scarcely be worse. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), unemployment in the UK has climbed to a five-year high, with retail and hospitality hit particularly hard. These sectors have traditionally absorbed young workers and career switchers. Now they are among the first to feel the pressure of automation and slowing consumer demand.At the same time, the entry point into work is narrowing. Job platform Adzuna found last year that entry-level roles, including apprenticeships, junior positions, and graduate jobs, have fallen by nearly a third since ChatGPT entered public use in 2022. For many young people, the first step into employment is no longer guaranteed.This is not simply about layoffs. It is about opportunity evaporating.Graduate programmes are pared back. Junior analyst roles are folded into AI workflows. Apprenticeships are redesigned around software instead of supervision. The losses are spread across industries, making them harder to see but no less real.Even knowledge workers are feeling the squeezeAutomation was once associated with factory floors and call centres. That boundary has disappeared. The threat now stretches deep into professional and creative work.Britain’s economy makes it especially vulnerable. With its heavy reliance on services, finance, and professional sectors, the UK sits directly in the path of generative AI. There is little manufacturing cushion to absorb displaced workers. Efficiency gains translate rapidly into fewer jobs.What emerges is a labour market being reshaped from the inside out.Productivity rises, people disappear.From the corporate perspective, AI delivers clear returns. It drafts documents, summarises meetings, handles customer queries, and analyses data. Teams move faster. Costs fall.But nationally, the pattern is troubling.Each productivity gain removes another layer of junior roles. Fewer assistants. Fewer trainees. Fewer pathways into stable careers. What remains is a slimmer workforce managed by senior professionals overseeing automated systems.This is how a job market becomes dangerous—not through dramatic collapses, but through quiet erosion.Morgan Stanley’s figures show Britain leading major economies in AI-related job losses. Combined with rising unemployment and shrinking entry-level hiring, the trend points to a widening gap between those who design AI and those displaced by it.Change—or warning?Supporters argue this is simply transition: technology replacing old roles while creating new ones. History offers some comfort. Yet today’s pace is different, and so is the concentration of impact.Workers displaced from retail or administration cannot easily pivot into AI engineering. Graduates face fewer openings. Mid-career professionals compete not only with peers but with software that never clocks out.The Morgan Stanley report calls it an early warning. The real question is whether Britain treats it as such.Because if AI continues to be deployed mainly as a cost-cutting tool rather than a platform for building new industries, the UK risks drifting into a labour market defined by fewer opportunities, narrower pathways, and deeper inequality.What is unfolding may look like technological change.

The Ivy League institution said the change will apply to students entering this fall, marking one of its most ambitious efforts yet to widen access to elite higher education.The move places Yale among a growing group of top-tier universities rethinking affordability as college costs continue to strain middle- and lower-income households across the US.According to the Associated Press, Yale previously covered all expected expenses for students from families earning below $75,000 annually. By lifting the threshold to $100,000, the university estimates that nearly half of American households with children aged 6 to 17 will now qualify for a full-cost waiver.What the new policy coversUnder the revised framework, Yale will waive tuition, housing, meals, and other mandatory fees for eligible students from families earning under $100,000 a year. For families with incomes below $200,000, the university will also waive tuition, though some additional costs may still apply.University officials said to the Associated Press that the expansion reflects a broader commitment to ensuring that financial circumstances do not stand in the way of academic opportunity.In its announcement, Yale emphasised that the policy is designed to reach deep into the middle class, families who often earn too much to qualify for traditional aid but too little to comfortably absorb the full price of an Ivy League education.Part of a wider shift across elite campusesYale’s decision comes amid mounting pressure on prestigious universities to confront the reality of rising tuition and widening inequality in access to higher education. Over the past few years, several elite institutions have introduced similar measures, expanding aid packages and revising income thresholds in response to concerns that top campuses are increasingly out of reach for ordinary families.Education commentators suggest that these alterations show a gradual acknowledgment that merit by itself will not be sufficient if financial barriers continue to be deeply rooted. Yale is sending a message that it is placing affordability at the core of its admissions strategy and it is no longer a matter of secondary concern by offering full support to families earning up to $100,000 and partial relief up to $200,000.Beyond generosity, a strategic recalibrationWhile framed as an equity-driven initiative, the policy also carries strategic weight. Elite universities are competing for talented students from diverse economic backgrounds, and financial accessibility has become a defining factor in where high-achieving applicants choose to enroll.For Yale, the expanded aid programme is both a moral statement and a practical recalibration, an acknowledgment that the future of higher education depends on opening doors wider, not narrowing them.As reported by the Associated Press, the university believes the revised thresholds will dramatically broaden its reach, allowing thousands more families to realistically consider Yale without the burden of long-term debt.A signal moment for higher educationYale’s announcement highlights a significant change in how America’s most powerful academic institutions view responsibility and access. At a time when student debt dominates national conversations, the move offers a clear message: Elite education does not have to remain the preserve of the wealthy. Whether other universities follow suit remains to be seen.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"
timesofindia,education,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/penn-state-graduate-workers-clash-with-university-over-research-assistant-union-rights/articleshow/127690811.cms,2026-01-28T15:30:00+00:00,"Last October, graduate students at Penn State delivered a decisive message. In a campus-wide election, nearly 90% of participating voters backed the formation of a union, marking a turning point after years of organising. For many students who juggle teaching, research, and academic responsibilities, the result felt like long-overdue recognition of their role in keeping the university running.The new union, represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW), is meant to cover graduate assistants, most notably teaching assistants and research assistants. But weeks after the results were certified, Penn State moved to challenge part of that victory.University appeals over research assistant inclusionThe university has filed an appeal with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (PLRB), objecting specifically to the inclusion of research assistants (RAs) in the bargaining unit. Teaching assistants and administrative support assistants, Penn State says, are not part of the dispute.In a statement on its “grad facts” website, Penn State explained its position to Centre Daily Times: “The University's position is that the RA role is unique from other graduate assistant positions because research is an integral part of their academic training and degree requirements, guided by individualized faculty mentorship and scholarly expectations.”Activities such as designing research, developing methodologies, collaborating with teams, and building academic independence, the university argues, are central to earning advanced degrees, making the RA role fundamentally different from other assistantships.At the same time, Penn State says it plans to move forward with negotiations covering teaching assistants and administrative support assistants. “As the University community waits for the PLRB to review the matter and issue a decision, activities will continue as usual, and Penn State will remain committed to providing a supportive environment for every graduate assistant,” the statement said.Graduate students push backFor graduate organisers, that reassurance rings hollow. In a December 12 newsletter, the Coalition of Graduate Employees at Penn State described the appeal as “deeply disappointing,” arguing that it undermines the collective will expressed at the ballot box.“We all know that RAs are workers who are essential to the research operations of Penn State,” the newsletter mentioned. “Tens of thousands of graduate student research assistants at dozens of other universities across the country have formed unions and successfully negotiated contracts that have made significant improvements to working conditions.”The group launched a petition calling on Penn State to withdraw its appeal. Alongside it, organisers laid out 10 priorities for negotiations, including: fair pay, comprehensive healthcare, protection from harassment and discrimination, support for international and parenting graduate assistants, guaranteed paid leave, strong union representation, an accessible grievance process, and safer, more productive workplaces.Years of organizing and broader union momentumThis election was the culmination of years of organising. Roughly 5,000 graduate students were eligible to vote, after an unsuccessful union attempt in 2017–18. This time, the margin was overwhelming.Union momentum at Penn State extends beyond graduate workers. In December, the Penn State Faculty Alliance filed a petition to hold a union election for faculty members, signalling growing interest in collective representation across the university.The road aheadAs the PLRB weighs Penn State’s appeal, the campus finds itself at a crossroads. For administrators, the question centres on how graduate research fits into academic training. For students, it is simpler: whether research assistants—who power much of the university’s scholarly output—will be recognised as workers with a seat at the bargaining table.Whatever the board decides, one thing is already clear. Penn State’s graduate students have found their voice—and they are determined to use it.Ready to navigate global policies? Secure your overseas future. Get expert guidance now!"

Ajit Pawar never stopped chasing the top job and his politics always carried the impatience of a man running out of time. A six-time deputy chief minister, feared for his authority, respected for his administrative grip and often criticised for his rough edges, Pawar seemed perennially poised for Maharashtra's top chair, yet never quite arrived there. On Wednesday morning, his life ended suddenly in a plane crash near Baramati, his home turf, leaving behind a career defined as much by influence as by unfulfilled ambition.Ajit Pawar (66) was travelling from Mumbai to Baramati to campaign for local elections when the aircraft crashed during approach. All five on board were killed, including two of his staff and two crew members. Investigations are under way with authorities yet to confirm what caused the crash.But beyond the headlines of a tragic death lies a larger political story, that of a grassroots leader who mastered the state's rural power networks, repeatedly reached the doorstep of power and then watched the chief ministership remain just out of reach.Here are 5 turning points of his life and politics:1. Built in Baramati, forged in co-operative beltAjit Pawar's political education began not in television studios but in Maharashtra's most durable power factory - the sugar and co-operative ecosystem. Born on July 22, 1959, to Asha and Anantrao Pawar, he entered politics in 1982, when he was elected to a sugar factory board, following his uncle Sharad Pawar's path.The Baramati brand gave him what few leaders possess, a constituency that functions like a fortress and a political machinery that runs year-round. His rise was not accidental charisma. It was organisational engineering.2. Deputy CM and the puntual 'workaholic' Pawar became deputy CM multiple times across shifting coalitions, with a record six stints, and earned the reputation of a punctual workaholic, unusual in a political culture infamous for delays.This was the phase that shaped his strongest political identity, the administrator who can ""deliver"". Even rivals grudgingly admitted that he understood how the state's machinery worked, and how to push it. His command over finance and planning ministries further consolidated that authority. He was expected to table the 2026–27 Maharashtra budget next month.3. Controversies that bruised him, but didn't break himIf Pawar's supporters saw him as the decisive doer, his critics saw a leader who attracted controversies as routinely as he attracted power. Allegations linked to the irrigation scam and later controversies around his son Parth's land deal became recurring political ammunition against him. Yet the pattern was consistent: the man stayed standing.His most infamous public controversy came in 2013, when he mocked the state's drought crisis while addressing a rural gathering in Indapur, leading to outrage and a forced apology. The episode revealed both sides of his persona: politically astute, and often unfiltered.4: The 2019 dawn swearing-in and the power hunger In November 2019 came the political move that turned him from a state heavyweight into a national plotline: the surprise early-morning swearing-in with Devendra Fadnavis. Ajit Pawar became deputy CM in a government that lasted barely two days, but its impact lingered far longer.This wasn't merely opportunism. It was a signal. Pawar never hid his ambition for the CM post. That morning was widely seen as him stepping out of the ""uncle’s heir"" frame and into the ""I can take power"" frame. It didn’t succeed, but it permanently defined him as Maharashtra’s most unpredictable power player.5. 2023 split from Sharad Pawar, then a reunionIn July 2023, Ajit Pawar executed the biggest rupture of his career - he rebelled against Sharad Pawar, walked away with most MLAs, and aligned with the BJP-Shiv Sena government. The move didn't just split a party, it split a legacy.Yet politics rarely respects personal drama. After a poor Lok Sabha showing where his faction won only one seat, he bounced back in the assembly polls with 41 seats, strengthening his position and silencing critics, at least temporarily.Then came the twist again. Ahead of civic polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, Ajit Pawar and Sharad Pawar were seen effectively reuniting strategically to avoid vote-splitting. Pawar publicly justified it as practical politics, two factions fighting each other would only help opponents.That ""reunion"" fuelled speculation about a future merger of the factions, buzz that now hangs unresolved in the air after his sudden death.Six times deputy CM, Ajit Pawar remained the state’s most relentless power operator, feared by rivals and valued by allies. He shaped governments, split parties and rewrote equations, often overnight. He didn’t become chief minister, but in Maharashtra's politics, few controlled the field like he did."

Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”"

My case is ‘Rahul Dewan and Ors vs Union’,” the lawyer told the court. Responding to this, the Chief Justice said, “We know what is happening. Make sure defects are cured. We will list it.” The challenge pertains to the University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, notified on January 13. The new regulations mandate all higher education institutions to constitute “equity committees” to examine complaints of discrimination and promote equity on campuses.Under the regulations, these equity committees must include members from the Other Backward Classes (OBC), Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), persons with disabilities, and women. The 2026 regulations replace the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2012, which were largely advisory in nature.The plea assails the regulations on the ground that caste-based discrimination has been defined strictly as discrimination against members of the SC, ST and OBC categories. It argues that by limiting the scope in this manner, the UGC has effectively denied institutional protection and grievance redressal to individuals belonging to the general or non-reserved categories who may also face harassment or bias based on their caste identity.Meanwhile, protests have been reported from various places against the new regulations, with student groups and organisations demanding their immediate rollback."

The crash of Flight AI171, which killed 260 people, is being questioned by an NGO for allegedly violating citizens' fundamental rights. The NGO claims the official probe wasn't thorough enough.Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, representing the NGO 'Safety Matters Foundation', told the court that neither the government nor the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) had responded to the petition. He said, ""The entire pilots association are saying there is a problem in the Boeing 787 aircraft which needs to be grounded."" The apex court is currently handling three separate petitions seeking an independent investigation. These include requests from the NGO, a law student, and Captain Sabharwal's father. The pilots' federation has specifically asked for a court-monitored inquiry led by a former Supreme Court judge. While SC agreed to hear the pleas, no date has been given yet. “SIR (hearing on pleas related to special intensive revision of electoral rolls pleas) will be over today, and we will give you a short date,” the CJI told Bhushan.Earlier, on November 13, the court had noted that the AAIB's preliminary report didn't blame Captain Sabharwal for the crash. However, the court criticised the selective publication of this report, calling it ""unfortunate and irresponsible"" as it created a misleading media narrative about pilot error.Bhushan argued that such a major accident requires a more thorough court of inquiry rather than just an AAIB investigation. The Chief Justice has promised to schedule a hearing soon, after completing the current special intensive revision of electoral rolls cases.The Boeing 787-8 aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Captain Clive Kunder, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad while heading to London's Gatwick airport.

The calls are being ranged from a DGCA-led probe to a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry.Ajit Pawar (66) was among five people killed when a Learjet 45 aircraft crash-landed near Baramati airport in Pune district on Wednesday morning. The aircraft was operated by Delhi-based VSR Ventures and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said there were five people on board, including crew members. Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh expressed his condolences over the death of NCP leader. Raising concerns over the circumstances of the crash, he said that several questions needed to be answered, including visibility conditions, landing protocol and aircraft maintenance. “The question is, why did this accident happen? From the preliminary information I have received, a similar accident involving the same company occurred in Mumbai three years ago. This incident took place in low visibility. Normally, landing should not be attempted unless visibility is at least five kilometres,” he said. Singh added that the aircraft reportedly attempted to land twice before missing the airstrip.“The DGCA should conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. It must also be examined who was responsible for the aircraft’s maintenance and whether DGCA clearance had been granted,” Singh said. Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also called for a probe, describing Pawar’s death as untimely and deeply shocking.“We will demand an investigation into this accident. It is a very sad incident. Ajit Pawar died a premature death. The passing away of a hard-working man has shocked us all. We are with his family in this hour,” Kharge said.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament House complex, Kharge said Pawar had worked for the people and his death had hurt everyone. “This has hurt everyone, including his family members, and we share their grief and pray that they can bear this loss,” he said.Earlier, in a post on X, Kharge said Pawar’s death was “deeply shocking and profoundly distressing,” calling it an untimely loss of a leader with a long political career ahead. He said Pawar would be remembered as a seasoned politician who served Maharashtra in various constitutional roles.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee demanded a Supreme Court-supervised inquiry and alleging that existing agencies could not be trusted.“We trust only the Supreme Court. All other agencies have been completely compromised,” Banerjee told reporters before leaving for Singur, asserting that only a court-monitored probe would bring out the truth.She also alleged a possible political conspiracy, claiming there were reports that Pawar was considering leaving the BJP days before the crash.“Two days ago, I came to know that someone from another party had given a statement that Pawar was willing to leave the BJP, and now this has happened today,” she said, while adding that Pawar was reportedly preparing to return to the NCP faction led by his uncle Sharad Pawar.“It is truly a great loss. My condolences to his family, the people of Maharashtra, and to Sharad Pawar,” Banerjee said.The Biju Janta Dal also joined other opposition parties in demanding a thorough investigation. BJD VP Debi Prasad Mishra said, “It is shocking news that Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra and a regional party leader, died in a plane crash at Baramati. He was a vibrant leader with a strong reputation as a doer, held important portfolios in Maharashtra, and worked extensively for the people. He was also the cousin of the legendary leader Sharad Pawar. This is very unfortunate, and the matter should be thoroughly investigated.”"

On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity. In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership. Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent. How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students? What the regulations aim to doThe objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability. The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs)Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (EBC)Economically Weaker Sections (EWS)Persons with disabilitiesThis prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.How the law frames discrimination and equityThe definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations. “Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment. It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt. “Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework. “Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities. Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees. Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment. This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination. The Equal Opportunity CentreEvery higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Composition and powers of EOCEach Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:Senior faculty membersA non-teaching staff representativeCivil society membersStudent representatives (as special invitees)The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Equity squads and ambassadorsBeyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations. These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions. The Equity HelplineEvery HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused. Reporting and inquiryThe procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Appeals and oversightAny person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress. Monitoring and penaltiesThe regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:Debarment from UGC schemesLoss of permission to offer degree or online programmeRemoval from UGC-recognised listsThese penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy. Fallout and concernsDespite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses. The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.Vice-chancellors also said the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations.Does it go against Article 14?The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.Beyond the rulebookThe 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses."

The silver medals, which are already procured/available in stock with railways, may be accounted for and suitably used for other activities, redressing their utilisation concerns.”Though the circular did not mention any reason for the decision, officials said that there have been various concerns, including the poor quality of medals supplied by outsourced vendors and need for cost-cutting as silver has become expensive.The practice had been continuing since March 2006 when the ministry decided to present all railway employees who seek voluntary retirement or superannuate with a gold-plated silver medal weighing around 20 grams.An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision addresses two issues: one of quality and second of the end of a culture which doesn’t exist in any other ministry or department. Sharing a contrasting view, another official said the national transporter could have fixed the problem and ensured that the quality of medals was not compromised.“Rather than giving the task of procurement of these medals to zones and production units, railways could have tied up with agencies like MMTC for getting them,” said the official."

Known for his good command and authority across party lines. He was serving his sixth term as deputy chief minister of Maharashtra in the BJP-led Mahayuti government, headed by CM Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde. He was also the national president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).Ajit Pawar emerged from the influential Pawar political family and rose under the towering legacy of his uncle, veteran leader Sharad Pawar, an octogenarian who had earlier served as chief minister of the state.In 2023, the NCP split into two factions when Ajit Pawar broke away to align with the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance. Sharad Pawar left with the remaining faction and chose not to support the BJP–Shiv Sena government in the state.Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Election Commission recognised the faction led by Ajit Pawar as the “real” NCP, awarding it the party name and symbol, while Sharad Pawar’s faction continued as NCP (SCP).Also read | PM Modi condoles Ajit Pawar's death, recalls his dedicationAjit Pawar represented the Baramati assembly constituency for seven consecutive terms starting in 1991, winning each election by comfortable margins. His political strength was firmly rooted in Maharashtra’s powerful cooperative sector.'Dada' served as chairman of the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank for 16 years, giving him deep influence over sugar cooperatives and milk unions across western Maharashtra. Over the years, he handled almost every major ministerial portfolio in the state, including water resources, power and rural development, serving under different chief ministers Vilasrao Deshmukh, Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan, Uddhav Thackeray and most recently Devendra Fadnavis.Ajit Pawar’s political relevance was shaped by his readiness to take bold — and often contentious-- decisions.In a dramatic early-morning move in November 2019, he took oath as deputy chief minister alongside BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. The experiment lasted just 80 hours before he returned to the fold led by his uncle, Sharad Pawar. In July 2023, he made his most decisive break yet, engineering a vertical split in the NCP and joining the Eknath Shinde-led government -- a move that directly challenged the 25-year leadership of his uncle and political mentor.Despite the turbulence, Pawar was widely respected within the bureaucracy for his “pro-action” style of functioning and his firm grip on administration.Follow live updates hereAjit Pawar was married to Sunetra Pawar and has two sons, Jay and Parth. From the cooperative sector to the highest levels of state politics, his journey remained closely tied to Baramati, the constituency that shaped his political life."

There is no politics involved; it is purely an accident,"" Sharad Pawar said.""It has caused immense grief to me and to the entire state of Maharashtra. I appeal to everyone not to politicise this tragedy,"" he added.This comes after the opposition demanded an enquiry over the plane crash in which Ajit Pawar was onboard.Just hours after the accident West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged a ""political conspiracy"" behind the plane crash and demanded a Supreme Court-supervised probe.""I don't know what is the fate of the opposition political parties but he was very much with the ruling party. But two days ago, I came to know that someone from another party had given a statement that Pawar was willing to leave the BJP, and now this has happened today,"" she alleged.""I demand a proper investigation under the supervision of the Supreme Court. We have trust only in the Supreme Court and no other agency. All agencies have been completely compromised,"" she added.She further alleged that Pawar was preparing to rejoin the Nationalist Congress Party faction led by his uncle, Sharad Pawar (NCP-SP), citing recent reports that have suggested such a possibility.Additionally, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also called for a probe, describing Pawar’s death as untimely and deeply shocking.“We will demand an investigation into this accident. It is a very sad incident. Ajit Pawar died a premature death. The passing away of a hard-working man has shocked us all. We are with his family in this hour,” Kharge said.Pawar, along with his PSO and three cabin crew members, died in a fatal plane crash while travelling from Mumbai to Baramati. The plane crashed while attempting to land at the Baramati airfield.The crash occurred around 8.48 am, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau have dispatched probe teams to the site of the mishap to investigate.Ajit Pawar was the longest-serving deputy chief minister of Maharashtra non-consecutively.

In the resurfaced video, Pawar is seen recounting a tense helicopter journey he undertook in July 2024 with then deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and industries minister Uday Samant.The incident occurred when the three leaders were flying from Nagpur to Gadchiroli to attend the foundation stone-laying ceremony of a steel plant amid poor weather conditions.Addressing the gathering after their arrival, Pawar narrated how the helicopter entered thick cloud cover, leaving no visibility outside.Describing the moment, he said, “When we started from Nagpur in the helicopter, it was fine at first. But later, when the helicopter entered the clouds, I looked this way and that way—there were clouds everywhere. And our Devendra Fadnavis was just sitting there, casually chatting.” Pawar went on to recall how he expressed his anxiety to Fadnavis during the flight. “I told him—‘Look outside, we can’t see anything, no trees, no ground, nothing. We are flying blindly through the clouds. Where are we even going?’” he said. According to Pawar, Fadnavis responded calmly, telling him not to worry. “He said—‘Don’t worry at all. I have experienced six such incidents so far. Whenever I am in a helicopter or a plane and an accident occurs, nothing happens to me. So, nothing will happen to you either.’”Pawar added that the reassurance did little to ease his nerves at the time. “I thought to myself—‘My goodness, what is he saying? I already had a sinking feeling in my stomach! Today is Ashadhi Ekadashi, so I was constantly chanting ‘Panduranga, Panduranga’ in my mind. And here was this ‘Maharaj’ giving me advice,” he said, drawing laughter from the audience.He later highlighted that despite the fear, the journey ended safely. “It is the good deeds of his elders that we reached here safely; those good deeds helped us,” Pawar remarked. Recalling the moment when the ground finally became visible, he said, “Uday Samant was sitting to my right and said, ‘Dada, Dada, look! The ground is finally visible.’ I said—‘Thank God, we can see the ground now!’ Jokes apart, everyone must take care.”He was travelling from Mumbai to Pune district to address multiple rallies ahead of the February 5 zilla parishad elections. The accident has triggered widespread grief across the political spectrum, with leaders recalling his long public life and distinctive personality.According to officials, the Learjet carrying Pawar attempted a landing at Baramati amid poor visibility and carried out a go-around before being cleared again. Moments after receiving clearance, the aircraft failed to provide a read-back to air traffic control and crashed near the runway, bursting into flames.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has taken over the probe. Civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said that the aircraft was trying to land in poor visibility. The jet, operated by VSR Ventures Pvt Ltd, was carrying five people on board, including Pawar, his personal security officer Vidip Jadhav, flight attendant Pinky Mali, Captain Sumit Kapoor and co-pilot Shambhavi Pathak. All five were killed.Pawar is survived by his wife Sunetra, a Rajya Sabha member and his two sons, Parth and Jay. The Maharashtra government has announced a three-day state mourning, with his last rites to be held with full state honours in Baramati on Thursday. President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and several other leaders have expressed grief over his death."

This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country. Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move. “Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure. “Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories."

Our scale gives us global influence, whether in trade, security or international relations. This is why India has risen to the top of global politics, a development Europe welcomes.” She said the partnership was entering a new phase. “Just imagine what we can achieve if we combine Europe’s and India’s resources. This is precisely why we are here today. It is a decisive moment in our partnership with our free trade agreement. And this is only the beginning,” she said.Von der Leyen said the agreements send a message at a time of global uncertainty. “We are sending a strong signal to the world. In a time when the world is becoming more fractured and fractious, India and Europe are choosing dialogue, collaboration, and cooperation.”She stressed that the partnership goes beyond trade. “Today is about more than economics.

With Parliament in session, I had booked my ticket directly from Dubai to Delhi,"" he told reporters. With the Budget session of Parliament starting on Wednesday, Congress legislative party (CPP) chairperson and former party chief Sonia Gandhi convened a meeting of the Congress' parliamentary strategy group at her residence to decide on the issues to be raised during the session.Sources confirmed that Tharoor, the four-time Thiruvananthapuram MP who has held the seat since 2009, could not attend the meeting as he was returning from Dubai. They added that the former diplomat had informed the party in advance about his inability to be present.Meanwhile, Tharoor said he would convey his ""issues"" directly to the Congress top leadership.""Whatever issues I need to raise, I will convey them directly to the party leadership. There is no doubt that I will get that opportunity, especially since everyone will be together during the Parliament session,"" he added.In recent months, Tharoor's repeated praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government has irked the Congress, leading to him being ""sidelined"" from party affairs. He has been particularly vocal in his support for the government on Operation Sindoor, the five-day India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025. On the other hand, the Congress has sought to corner the Centre over alleged losses of Indian fighter jets during the conflict and US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating the truce between the two nuclear-armed rivals."

It emphasises the contours of “techno-legal” AI governance framework that is necessary to mitigate risks while preserving flexibility and innovation.The 40-page paper also highlights India’s pro-innovation approach to AI governance, which integrates baseline legal safeguards, sector-specific regulations, technical controls and institutional mechanisms.“Developing a robust and responsive governance framework is not just a regulatory necessity but a prerequisite for sustaining the momentum of technological progress. The techno-legal approach offers a viable pathway by embedding legal, technical and institutional safeguards into AI systems by design,” said PSA Ajay Kumar Sood during the release of the white paper on Jan 23.In his foreword to the paper, he noted that while AI has significant “transformative potential”, it is essential to ensure that the associated risks and harm do not undermine trust or become a barrier to innovation and adoption.Exploring laws, rules and regulatory mechanisms, the framework suggests ways and means in which AI can be used securely without eroding public trust. The paper also signifies India’s contribution to making the entire ecosystem safe, of which its hosting of the AI Impact Summit 2026, the first-ever global AI summit to be held in the Global South, is an indicator.India as the summit’s host will shape a future-oriented agenda for impactful AI cooperation and help mark a strategic shift from ""action"" to ""Impact"".The upcoming summit aims to ensure that AI serves as a catalyst for inclusive human development, environmental sustainability and equitable progress worldwide, bridging the Global AI Divide through concrete multilateral action.The publication is the second in the White Paper series on ‘Emerging Policy Priorities for India’s AI Ecosystem’ that aims at deepening understanding and fostering informed discussion on critical AI policy issues.The first White Paper in the series, released in Dec 2025, focused on “democratising access to AI infrastructure”, highlighting the need to treat AI infrastructure as a shared national resource and identifying key enablers such as access to high-quality datasets, affordable computing resources and integration with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), said the office of PSA in a statement."

The CJI made the remark while responding to senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for a petitioner, and alleged “mass deletions” from the final voter list.Sibal countered by arguing that annual revisions already exist and that a wholesale special revision required “strong justification,” which he stressed should be supported by data. He also argued that although the poll body has plenary powers under Article 324 to conduct elections, the determination of citizenship lies exclusively with the Union government under the Citizenship Act.“This is not an ordinary administrative decision. This judgment will decide the future course of democracy in India,” he claimed.Meanwhile, the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi also observed that the mere possibility of forgery cannot be a ground to reject Aadhaar as one of the 12 documents used to verify a voter’s identity for electoral roll revision.“If a document is recognised by statute, it cannot be discarded merely because a private entity is involved in its issuance,"" Justice Bagchi said, referring to the UIDAI, the body that issues Aadhaar cards.He added that even passports are processed through private agencies performing public duties. The top court had commenced final arguments in the matter on August 12 last year, noting that the inclusion or exclusion of names in electoral rolls falls within the constitutional remit of the ECI.The ECI has consistently defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, stating that Aadhaar and voter identity cards cannot be treated as conclusive proof of citizenship. It maintains that ensuring only citizens are included in the electoral rolls is its constitutional duty, and that Aadhaar can at best be used to prevent duplication, not to establish citizenship.The commission has also denied allegations of political motive, emphasizing that deletions occurred across party lines.The hearing is expected to conclude on Thursday."

A: A lot of my books have the personal in them. I think this in some ways is the most personal. And it came about because I had this annus horribilis... And for me that was 2023 when I had this shock breast cancer diagnosis. And just as I was going through the treatment, I lost my mother very suddenly, I spoke to her the night before and then the next morning I got a call saying she's gone. And it left me feeling very unmoored. But it also set me off thinking about how I could traverse some of these inner terrains of illness, of grief, these emotional journeys... I've lived in eight countries, in nine different cities since the late 1990s. Doing so I've learned something about the art of travelling well... And then I thought about applying some of these to other kinds of journeys, more metaphorical journeys... And it helped me a lot because I realised that recasting illness and recasting grief and recasting some of these difficult life journeys as plot really helped me to process them and to bring to them an openness and a curiosity that I normally have in my travels to countries.Q: There is a bit about hanging on to your Indian passport, despite having been married to a Spaniard with a European passport for 25 years. A: I have a chapter on passportism, essentially a hierarchy that divides people and determines who can travel and who can't. Just as your caste is determined by birth, your passport is also usually determined by birth. It's a throw of the cosmic dice whether you're born in Sudan or whether you're born in the US. But if you happen to be lucky enough to born in the US or Spain, you have the keys to the world... Although I'm in a family of passport Brahmins, I have hung on to my Indian passport... We have a friend in, say, Mexico who invites us to a wedding. Everybody is like, yay, we’re going to Mexico. And being an Indian passport holder, my initial reaction is never unalloyed excitement. But I have hung on to this passport and I've tried to unpack why. There's notions of loyalty to the nation but I think there's also something more than that. It's this kind of sense of guilt almost that I have of being such a privileged Indian... And in some ways, that passport is at least to some extent a leveller... And the very liberal countries of the West for whom supposedly racism would be anathema, sexism would be anathema, casteism would be anathema, passportism is okay — so much so that you have these rankings that are public every year saying which is the best passport and which is the worst passport.Q: I've noticed that parenting is such an integral part of your being, how you have traversed as a mother and a journalist. A: I've tried through a lot of my work to break down the barrier between those two aspects. A journalist would be like defining my professional life. And being a mother is supposed to be something very private. And I think that's quite disingenuous... I believe this kind of division between the personal and the professional is spurious and it does not serve the interests of not only women, but men either... I feel like when you are writing anything,... it's very important to centre and make obvious your own subjectivity... We've had a tradition in foreign correspondence and travel writing of, normally, a white male writer, essentially pretending to take a kind of objective vantage point. They have this very authorial, universalistic voice which obscures the lenses that they are seeing the world through and is just telling you this is the truth... I think whenever we are talking about something, we are describing a version of the truth. And that version is very much determined by who is telling that story. And so I think it's important to make yourself quite transparent. So you are a female, you are a mother. And that is why you are apprehending the world in that way and interpreting the world in that way... You know, when they say ‘women can do it all’, what they actually mean is when you're at work, you pretend that you don't have kids, and when you are with the kids, you have to pretend that you don't have work. And that's just patently, empirically impossible.Q: And parents, predominantly mothers, end up competing with each other. A: In the chapter on pedagogy, I talk about this phase that I go through of being this kind of typical Asian tiger mom. A lot of how I process the world is through books. In this instance, it happened to be a book by a writer called Amy Chua, ‘Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother’... So I went through a very misguided phase, at least as far as I'm concerned, given my personal predilections as a parent, of being this tiger mom... Until I realised that, I was... creating misery all around. After a few months, I felt my claws retract and the stripes on my body dissolved into colourful polka dots... The last five years we've spent in Spain and there, sometimes I wish people were more tiger momish. They're only concerned about if the kids are playing sports and if they have girlfriends and boyfriends... There's no conversation about how they're doing in math or what university they might want to apply to. So I think it’s about finding a good balance, and also realising all these things are culture-dependent, context-dependent. Q: You discover in China that names given to you give you different kinds of freedoms and perspectives. A: I think one of the important parts of travelling is to accumulate a variety of different lenses and perspectives and to expand your sense of self... Supposing you're an Indian. You have various assumptions about the world and you don't even realise that these are assumptions because you just think that they're somehow universal norms... You travel, you learn new languages, you experience new cultures, and you understand there's so many different ways in which you can inhabit the world, in which you can translate the world, and hopefully you can accrue more and more of these lenses so that you become a wider person... I just use the metaphor of my Chinese name as a way of talking about an extra lens that I acquired by becoming familiar with Chinese culture and Chinese ways of doing things... I think that when we proselytise about the virtues of travel, we also have to keep in mind what we started this discussion off with — passportism, and that not everybody can travel in the same way... So there are other ways of travelling. You can even become a traveller in your neighbourhood. If you walk around your own colony and you look at it with openness and curiosity instead of allowing what is the quotidian to become banal... My name, Pallavi, is distorted in so many ways. I've been called Pullover and Pavlova and Pavali. But instead of complaining, I've embraced each iteration. It's just one more way of being."

It has to be pursued with a comprehensive outlook and without any discrimination, no 'mine' or 'yours', no caste, religion, language or regional bias. This discrimination-free approach alone reflects the true spirit of Ram Rajya,"" the chief minister said.The programme, marking the inauguration of the Siddharthnagar Mahotsav, was attended by Leader of Opposition in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly and Itwa MLA Mata Prasad Pandey, state minister Anil Rajbhar, Dumariaganj MP Jagdambika Pal and other public representatives.Adityanath paid tributes to Lord Buddha, describing Siddharthnagar as a sacred land that gave the world the message of compassion and harmony. He also expressed condolences over the reported death of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in an airplane crash and extended sympathies to the bereaved families.Calling the inaugurated projects a ""collective effort"", the chief minister said the proposals came from public representatives and were approved on merit.""We are only a medium. When justified proposals come, funds are released without discrimination,"" he said.Highlighting the transformation of Siddharthnagar, once classified as an aspirational district, Adityanath said the region earlier suffered from poor infrastructure, disease and migration. He noted that encephalitis, which had claimed lives for decades, was eliminated within a few years after 2017 through sustained efforts inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Those who lost their lives were not vote banks for us. They were part of our family, and the government fulfilled its responsibility,"" he said.The chief minister said Siddharthnagar now has improved road connectivity, including four-lane highways linking the district with neighbouring regions and Nepal, which would boost investment and employment.He added that the Shamli-Gorakhpur corridor passing through Dumariaganj, Bansi and Itwa would act as a development corridor for the area.Referring to infrastructure expansion, Adityanath cited the establishment of a medical college, the start of a nursing college, the inauguration of a women's hostel and plans for a 1,000-seat auditorium under corporate social responsibility initiatives.He also spoke about welfare schemes, saying benefits such as ration, toilets, housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Ayushman Bharat health cards must reach every poor household without discrimination.""This is the essence of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas',"" he said.Urging farmers to diversify cropping patterns, Adityanath appealed to them to adopt a third crop in addition to the traditional two, citing examples from Kannauj, Auraiya and Kanpur Dehat where maize cultivation has yielded additional income of nearly Rs 1 lakh per acre.The chief minister also called for recognising and honouring artists, sportspersons, traders and others doing exemplary work at the local level during district festivals to foster healthy competition and positive energy."

Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work. Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”. They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economyMuslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions. Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads. Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short."

Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine."

The controversy erupted during the debate on the motion of thanks to the governor’s address to the joint sitting of the state legislature. BJP legislators alleged that the Congress government had accessed details of phone calls received at the Raj Bhavan (Lok Bhavan), raising serious questions about surveillance and misuse of power.Last week, on January 22, governor Gehlot refused to read the full state-prepared address to the joint session of the legislature and concluded his speech in just three lines. The move drew sharp criticism from the Congress government. The governor had objected to certain references in the address that were critical of the Centre, including remarks on the alleged “repeal” of the UPA-era employment guarantee scheme, MGNREGA.Intervening in the debate on Wednesday, BJP MLA Suresh Kumar accused the state government of disrespecting the governor and making unwarranted allegations against a constitutional authority. He observed that there have been earlier instances where governors did not read their full addresses.Citing precedent, Kumar referred to January 2011, when the BJP was in power in the state. He said that then governor Hansraj Bhardwaj had tabled his address to the joint session to be treated as read after the then Leader of the Opposition, Siddaramaiah, urged him not to read it, alleging corruption by the BJP government at the time.Responding to this comparison, law minister H K Patil alleged that the present Governor had acted under instructions received over phone calls from Delhi.“Following calls from Delhi the Governor did not read the full speech, we will also have to speak about it now, as you spoke about the earlier incident (involving then Governor Bhardwaj),” Patil said.The remark triggered strong protests from the BJP benches. Suresh Kumar said that the law minister was making a grave allegation and questioned how the government knew about calls to the governor. “Is the government tapping the Raj Bhavan (Lok Bhavan) phones, to know about the Governor getting calls from Delhi?” he asked.As BJP MLAs rose in protest, the House descended into chaos. BJP MLA Sunil Kumar alleged that Patil’s statement amounted to an admission. “How can this be tolerated? This is the second time the Law Minister has said this in the House. Is phone tapping happening?” he said.IT/BT Minister Priyank Kharge came to Patil’s defence, saying the law minister was only alleging that the Governor was acting like a “puppet in the hands of the central government.” However, the BJP maintained that the statements raised serious doubts about surveillance at the Raj Bhavan.Escalating the exchange, Kharge alleged that the governor was receiving calls from Keshava Krupa, the RSS’s Karnataka state headquarters. BJP members countered the claim by saying the Congress “gets calls from Italy,” further intensifying the verbal sparring.Sunil Kumar and other BJP MLAs reiterated their charge that the state government had stooped to tapping the Governor’s phone. “The Law Minister has repeatedly said that the Governor was getting calls from Delhi. How did they know? If they have records, let them place it in the House,” he said, alleging that both Patil and Kharge were involved in tapping phones at Lok Bhavan.Senior BJP leaders, including Suresh Kumar and Sunil Kumar, continued to accuse the Siddaramaiah government of surveillance and described it as a “phone tapping government.” Leader of the Opposition R Ashoka also backed the allegations.Replying to the charges, Patil questioned why there had been no clarification from either the Governor or the Centre after he first made the allegation last week. “What is the Home Ministry doing in Delhi? Should they not at least issue a press note saying that there is no communication between the Governor and Home Ministry?” he asked.The remarks led to further heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches, with Ashoka claiming that the statements by Patil and Kharge themselves proved that phones at the Lok Bhavan and the RSS office were being tapped. “Are our phones also being tapped? This is a phone-tapping government,” he said.As disorder continued in the House, Speaker U T Khader adjourned the Assembly for lunch."

Despite the limited case count, neighbouring countries have moved to heighten vigilance. Thailand has begun screening passengers at three international airports receiving flights from West Bengal, while Nepal has initiated checks at Kathmandu airport and major land border points with India.Nipah virus is a rare but highly fatal zoonotic infection that spreads from animals to humans and through close human contact. Naturally harboured by fruit bats (flying foxes), the virus can cause symptoms ranging from fever and respiratory illness to acute encephalitis, with a case fatality rate of 40–75%. There is no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine, making early detection and strict infection control critical. The World Health Organization classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen due to its epidemic potential.Following confirmation of the two cases, the Centre, in coordination with the West Bengal government, activated comprehensive containment measures, including enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing and field investigations by central and state health teams.The ministry said 196 contacts linked to the cases were identified, traced, monitored and tested, with all found asymptomatic and negative. “These measures ensured timely containment, and no further spread has been detected,” it said.Health officials stressed that the screening measures adopted by Thailand and Nepal are precautionary, reflecting global sensitivity to Nipah’s high fatality rate rather than any escalation in India.“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health safeguards are in place,” the ministry said, urging the public and media to rely only on verified official information and avoid speculative reports.With no fresh cases detected and all contacts testing negative, authorities maintain that India’s response has been swift and effective, even as neighbouring countries err on the side of caution to prevent cross-border risk."

Flames were seen near the runway threshold moments after the clearance, prompting the immediate dispatch of emergency services to the site. All five people on board, including two crew members died. Baramati is an ""uncontrolled airfield"", where traffic information is shared by instructors or pilots from flying training organisations operating at the airport, rather than by a full-fledged Air Traffic Control (ATC) unit, the readout said.Initially, 'winds were calm'As per the account, the aircraft, registered VI-SSK, first established contact with Baramati at 8.18am. The next communication took place when the aircraft was 30 nautical miles inbound, after it was released by Pune Approach. The crew was advised to descend under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) at the pilot’s discretion.When the crew enquired about local conditions, they were informed that ""winds were calm"" and visibility was approximately 3,000 metres.""The crew enquired about the winds and visibility and they were informed that the winds were calm and visibility was around 3000 mts,"" the official statement said. 1st approach to landing: 'Runway not in sight'During the first approach to Runway 11, the crew reported that the ""runway was not in sight"". Following this, they initiated a go-around, aborting the landing attempt.After the go-around, the aircraft was asked to report its position. The crew responded that they were again on the final approach for Runway 11. They were instructed to report once the runway was visible.Initially, the crew said the runway was “currently not in sight” and that they would call back once it was visible. A few seconds later, they reported that the runway was in sight.""They were asked to report runway in sight. They replied 'runway is currently not in sight, will call when runway is in sight'.

An AAIB team is expected to visit the crash site to examine the wreckage and collect technical evidence related to the accident.A senior official told PTI that the investigation will focus on flight data, aircraft maintenance records, pilot logs, air traffic control communications and weather conditions at the time of the crash. The AAIB is India’s designated authority for probing aviation accidents and is responsible for classifying incidents and identifying technical, operational or human factors behind such crashes. The aircraft involved was a Learjet 45 with registration VT-SSK, operated by Delhi-based VSR Ventures. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, five people including two crew members were onboard the business jet when it crash-landed at Baramati airport. Preliminary reports indicate the aircraft lost control during the landing phase. Besides Ajit Pawar, the passengers included a personal security officer (Vidip Jadhav) and an attendant(Pinky Mali). The flight crew comprised Pilot-in-Command Sumit Kapur and Second-in-Command Shambhavi Pathak. Emergency services and senior security officials reached the site shortly after the crash, while local residents were among the first responders. Three bodies were shifted to Baramati Medical College, where identification procedures are underway, the Pune Superintendent of Police said. A DGCA team has also arrived at the site to assist in the preliminary assessment.The chartered aircraft belonged to VSR Ventures, the same operator whose plane had crashed at Mumbai airport on October 14, 2023. All passengers survived that incident, and a technical snag was cited as the cause. Preliminary information suggests a technical issue may have contributed to Wednesday’s crash as well.The flight was operating amid ongoing elections to Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis in Maharashtra. Pawar was travelling from Mumbai to Baramati to attend a public meeting, reflecting the heavy air travel schedules maintained by political leaders during election campaigns.The Baramati crash adds to a growing list of aviation incidents involving VVIP travel that have come under scrutiny in recent years. In October 2024, a helicopter scheduled to pick up NCP leader Sunil Tatkare crashed in Pune, while western Maharashtra has witnessed multiple emergency landings linked to sudden weather changes.The incident is expected to intensify scrutiny of charter operators, pilot duty hours and safety oversight in the non-scheduled aviation sector, which plays a critical role in political and administrative travel across the country.AAIB is India’s designated authority for investigating aviation safety occurrences within Indian airspace. Its mandate includes classifying events as accidents, serious incidents or incidents, and conducting detailed technical investigations into causes ranging from pilot error and mechanical failure to weather conditions and operational lapses.Unlike routine inquiries, AAIB investigations involve flight data analysis, examination of aircraft maintenance records, pilot logs, air traffic control communications and meteorological data. The bureau’s findings often result in safety recommendations aimed at regulators, operators and manufacturers to prevent future accidents."

A new study has found that dust storms rising from the deserts of western India are carrying airborne bacteria to Himalayan hilltops, including pathogens linked to respiratory, skin and gastrointestinal illnesses.Researchers from the Bose Institute, an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), traced this movement through more than two years of continuous monitoring of dust events and atmospheric samples across high-altitude sites in the eastern Himalayas. Their findings have been published in the journal “Science of the Total Environment”.Dust storms are a recurring feature of India’s arid regions, particularly during the pre-monsoon months. The study shows that as these storms rise from desert surfaces, they lift not only fine mineral particles but also bacteria attached to them. Driven by prevailing winds, the dust plumes travel hundreds of kilometres, crossing the densely populated and polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain before settling over Himalayan hilltops.Several of the airborne bacteria identified in the samples are known to be associated with respiratory and skin diseases. The findings are especially relevant for Himalayan populations, who already face heightened health vulnerability due to cold climatic conditions and hypoxia. Until now, there has been limited evidence directly linking long-range airborne microbial exposure to disease risks in high-altitude regions.The research also points to a parallel process shaping the Himalayan atmosphere. Vertical uplift from the Himalayan foothills injects locally sourced pollutants and pathogens into higher layers of the air. These local microbes then mix with long-range bacterial “travellers” arriving with desert dust, collectively altering the composition of the atmospheric bacterial community over the region.This combined effect, the researchers say, may also help explain the occurrence of gastrointestinal infections in high-altitude areas. By quantitatively demonstrating how both horizontal dust transport and vertical lifting of polluted air perturb the Himalayan atmospheric microbiome, the study adds a new biological dimension to the understanding of air pollution.Beyond its scientific contribution, the findings carry clear public health implications. Current air quality monitoring frameworks focus largely on chemical pollutants, often overlooking biological agents. The researchers argue that incorporating microbial surveillance could strengthen national health action plans and support the development of health forecasting systems, in line with the goals of Viksit Bharat by 2047.For regions long regarded as climatically pristine, the study serves as a reminder that even the highest mountain air is shaped by processes unfolding far beyond the Himalayas."

We are opening a new chapter in our relations – on trade, on security, on people-to-people ties,” Costa said at a press conference at the Hyderabad House in the presence of PM Modi and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen following the India–EU summit talks During his remarks, Costa highlighted his personal connection with India, saying he was “also an overseas Indian citizen,” and pulled out his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card from his suit pocket and showed it to the gathering.“Also because we conclude today our trade negotiations, we relaunched at the Leaders' meeting that I had the pleasure to host, in May 2021, in my previous capacity. Our summit sends a clear message to the world: at a time when the global order is being fundamentally reshaped, the European Union and India stand together as strategic and reliable partners,” Costa said.“Today, we are taking our partnership to the next level,” he added.“I am the President of the European Council, but I am also an overseas Indian citizen. Then, as you can imagine, for me, it has a special meaning. I am very proud of my roots in Goa, where my father's family came from. And, the connection between Europe and India is something personal to me,” he said.In line with their vision for a rules-based global order, India and the 27-nation EU bloc also rolled out a joint comprehensive strategic agenda for the next five years and finalised 13 agreements, including one related to the conclusion of FTA negotiations.The OCI scheme, meant for persons of Indian origin who are foreign nationals, was introduced through an amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955, in August 2005. A registered OCI holder is granted a multiple-entry, multi-purpose, lifelong visa to visit India, though the status does not provide political rights, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.Goa was a Portuguese territory for several centuries before it was liberated from colonial rule on December 19, 1961. Costa was born in Lisbon, Portugal, on July 17, 1961, nearly five months before Goa’s liberation.Earlier, Prime Minister Modi hosted von der Leyen and Costa for the summit talks in New Delhi.

Sadly, Section 175 BNSS is somewhat confusing and requires ironing out the creases in the legislation without altering the material of which it is woven,"" the bench said.The court said the legislative intention behind insertion of sub-section (4) of Section 175 was clear: Parliament intended it as an additional safeguard for public servants when a complaint was made against them. ""Cognizant of practical realities and to prevent false or frivolous allegations, it appears to us that the mandate is to obtain a report from the accused public servant's superior officer and to extend to such a public servant an opportunity to explain his side of the story. While society's interest is served by prosecuting offenders, it is equally vital, if not more, to ensure that prosecution is not launched against individuals, including public servants, to settle a score or wreak vengeance or put them in such an awkward position that it becomes difficult for them to act in a similar future occasion. The responsibility, nay duty, after all, is not just to pursue the actual culprit, but also to protect the innocent from being falsely implicated, wrongly accused and unnecessarily victimised,"" it said.Section 175(4) says any judicial magistrate empowered under Section 210 may, upon receiving a complaint against a public servant arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, take cognizance, subject to - (a) receiving a report containing facts and circumstances of the incident from the officer superior to him; and (b) after consideration of the assertions made by the public servant as to the situation that led to the incident so alleged.The court said sub-section (4) was not an independent provision but operated subject to the procedural safeguards that sub-section (3) embodied, including the requirement that the application be supported by an affidavit."

The group said such scrutiny is essential to enable an informed debate on the FTA’s implications for the pharmaceutical sector. Even though the pact does not explicitly talk about patent-related provisions, it provides a high level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights, including copyright, trademarks, designs, trade secrets and plant variety rights. The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity. ``The govt should clarify and ensure that the final text does not include any TRIPS-plus provisions, particularly patent term extensions and data exclusivity, which would compromise the availability of affordable medicines’’, KM Gopakumar, co-convenor, Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment told TOI. India plays an important role as a supplier of affordable generic medicines to low- and middle-income countries. Any weakening of its patent laws or regulatory framework through FTAs risks having an impact not only on patients in India, but millions worldwide who depend on Indian generic production, the group said. The agreement clearly demonstrates that India has agreed to IP protection and enforcement standards that go beyond the minimum obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). However, notably the press release (by EU) does not mention patent related provisions, nor does it clarify whether the agreement includes controversial TRIPS-plus measures such as patent term extensions, pharmaceutical data exclusivity, or other forms of market exclusivity for medicines, he added. Earlier, when negotiations were relaunched in 2022, the European Union’s proposed IP text explicitly sought patent term extension and data exclusivity protection for pharmaceutical products. In the previous rounds of negotiations, particularly during 2007-2013, India had rejected these TRIPS-plus demands following strong opposition from civil society, patent groups, and public health advocates.``We caution against repeating the approach adopted in the FTAs with EFTA and the UK that risk having a direct or indirect impact on access to affordable medicines’’, a statement from the patient advocacy group said. Further, it is also important to note that the EU–Mercosur agreement, reflects a shift away from the inclusion of patent related TRIPS-plus provisions in FTAs. This precedent should be followed in the EU-India agreement too, it added."
